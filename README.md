It's my [website](http://rei2hu.github.io)!

# About
First created in April, this repo contains the source of my website. Originally, it was put together from scratch. However, as a poor UI designer, the site would display properly for 1920x1080 monitors. On December 1st, 2016, I decided to remake the site using the javascript library [semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/).
