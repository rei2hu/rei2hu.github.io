<h1 id=i-forgot-to-unmute>i forgot to unmute</h1>
<p>Oftentimes, I observe someone making a small mistake and think to myself "that will never be me". An example of this is when someone is talking in a video meeting but forgets to unmute themselves - "that will never be me". But it recently was.</p>
<p>It was a small meeting consisting of myself (an engineer), a product manager, a designer, and a few others. The goal was to go over a new feature that I had just finished implementing last year, and make sure everyone was familiar with the ins and outs. We started out with the usual chit-chat; "how are you", "how was the break", "good and yours", "blah blah", and so on and got into the actual purpose of the meeting. I shared my screen and asked the usual "can everyone see my screen" (I'll never forget to share my screen when I'm supposed to fingers crossed) and started.</p>
<p>The content of the presentation isn't important here, but what happened is that I got through the entire thing until the end, where I waited for questions or requests and that's when I heard someone asking if I was looking for something, and that's when I realized I was muted for the entire presentation. Then I unmuted and gave the entire presentation again after we laughed about what just happened.</p>
<p>In my defense, the demo required a lot of screen real estate as it required having multiple user instances running in parallel, and I only use the 14-inch(?) built-in screen of my company provided laptop, so I ended up dragging the video conference software window offscreen to save space which led me to not see the muted icon on it and that's also possibly when I clicked the microphone icon which muted me. Or a hotkey did it when I was setting things up. Who knows?</p>
<p>Why did I write about this? I guess it's because it's a lesson to not judge people by a single small, common occurrence since I'll likely do the same in the future. I don't think I've done it for a while though - judge or make the mistake I've been trying to avoid - so I found this event entertaining.</p>
