<h1 id=first-travel-vacation-thoughts-and-lessons>first travel vacation thoughts and lessons</h1>
<p>I went on a vacation outside of my small town for the first time in my life this year. It was actually work related, but I talked my way into scheduling some time off afterwards for a vacation. The main benefit of this was that my company covered the flight and a few days at a hotel, though I had to pay for the rest of the days.</p>
<p>For privacy reasons, I'll try not to reveal any direct information about my trip. I will also round and factorize costs - 1@ represents a certain amount of money and will be the base unit for expenses.</p>
<p>The first thing I messed up was planning the trip itself. Because the company was covering travel, I opted to book a return flight for Monday instead of Sunday in an attempt to be cheap because I don't take advantage of other people's money. This saved the company 12@ but ultimately cost me 61@ for an extra night at the hotel, and I didn't realize it during planningâ€¦</p>
<p>The entire trip lasted 1 week, and I only packed electronic devices, toiletries, and clothes. What I forgot was a container for water, like a simple water bottle. I ended up having to buy overpriced water so I had a bottle I could refill throughout the vacation. I also packed extra clothes including clothes not fit for the weather; both did not come in handy but I think it could still be valuable.</p>
<p>Travel was uneventful, I had some very boring several hour layovers but got through them with books and computers. That's the downside of living in a small city I guess - no direct flights.</p>
<p>Seeing the metropolis for the first time was a shock - the public infrastructure there was much better and the area in general was very well maintained compared to my own town. Of course, there is the homeless issue which exists in many large cities, but I wouldn't say it was much worse than what I would see back home. The public transportation was abundant, clean, and very easy to use. I was able to take an hour long train ride from the airport to a station a few blocks away from the hotel. I was also able to take rides to the other various destinations I planned on visiting. It's possible there are some optimizations being made here to support tourists, though.</p>
<p>After checking in and dropping my luggage off in my room, I went out to eat dinner. My first meal was at a nearby hotel's restaurant and I had a sandwich and some soup. The total came out to 8@, which is around 50% what I would expect a meal to cost in my town. A 20% service charge AND the fact that I tip around 20% and some change to obtain certain numbers meant I ended up paying an extra 45% on top of the base cost. So, I spent over twice as much as I usual when eating out (the company would cover the base cost of that meal as it was during the work related days). But the price was still surprising to me - it was the first time I truly experienced the difference in cost of living between areas. The food wasn't to my taste either, but I'm not a picky eater.</p>
<p>This high cost trend wouldn't really continue, as the hotel meal turned out to be my most expensive one. I ended up spending around 90@ on food in total. There were a few stand out costs like non-alcoholic drinks costing 3@ but I'd chalk it up to the specialization. In general meals costed from 5@ to 6@ which seemed reasonable for the area. My second most expensive meal would be 7@, though that was technically breakfast and some leftovers for the airport. I would also eat at an airport, and I believe that airport food would be expensive as my parents never let us buy anything at airports but it was actually quite close in cost to food purchased outside the airport.</p>
<p>One unexpected thing was that all food/drink establishments in this area required providing your email for a receipt. I opted not to provide an email.</p>
<p>I spent around 25@ on entertainment, which covered the standard tourist attractions, and also visited other areas like the local university, parks, and walking trails which were free. I guess the experiences were decent, but honestly a lot of the paid attractions seemed overpriced for what they were. I did not take pictures or buy souvenirs, perhaps I should have? In retrospect, no - these memories are not that important. However, after experiencing what the city had to offer, I understand why people want to live in big metropolises; at least early on in their adult lives. However, I question how much of the fun was due to everything being new and if I would still enjoy it after months or years.</p>
<p>My total costs came out to around 400@ for everything, not including what the company covered, with over half of that for just the extra hotel days. This is crazy to me because that's maybe 3 or 4 months of typical expenses spent in a week. On the other hand, that's the amount of money that is gained or lost by my investments in a normal market day. I'm not sure if I can justify another travel vacation or not - especially one that's not covered by my employer.</p>
<p>So what would I do differently if I could redo things?</p>
<ol>
<li>Not wasting money by trying to save the company money<ul>
<li>Added an extra day to save money, but had to pay for hotel</li></ul></li>
<li>Bring basic containers and/or water bottles<ul>
<li>Bought overpriced water</li></ul></li>
<li>Not wasting time by trying to save the company money<ul>
<li>Scheduled some long layover flights</li>
<li>Schedule a red-eye flight</li></ul></li>
<li>Look for cheaper accommodations<ul>
<li>I extended my stay at the hotel my company booked, but it seemed quite expensive</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I think it went well if not a little expensive. But that could by my frugal brain talking after decades of being poor.</p>
