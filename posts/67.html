<p>An interesting behavior I came across recently was the interaction between filters and positioning. On this page is a red square with <code>fixed</code> position in the top left. When applying a filter to its parent element by toggling the checkbox, the element is suddenly positioned relative to the block.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because the <code>filter</code> property (among others) will create a new "containing block" that determines the position of <code>absolute</code> and <code>fixed</code>
elements. This behaviour is document in the specification so is not a bug. The discussion where the idea originated is around
<a href=https://www.w3.org/2015/02/10-fx-minutes.html#action02>here</a>. Unfortunately the jsfiddle in the recording does not exist anymore, but based on the conversation, the idea is for solving another issue.</p>
<p>In my case, I was using a combination of a filter as highlighting and creating a child element as a tooltip. The tooltip was position by the mouse coordinates and when a filter was applied, it was no longer by the mouse. I was able to append the tooltip element to the document body instead as a workaround.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this does not seem to be an issue on Safari. Or rather Safari is not spec compliant because it does not exhibit this behavior; but we've always known it wasn't, haven't we.</p>
