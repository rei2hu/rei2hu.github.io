Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=complaining-about-the-next-generation>complaining about the next generation</h1>
<p>I see a lot of discourse online about how today's teenagers and early 20s (relative to the date of the post) act quite disrespectfully and unhinged. I also see a lot of discussion on how many are unmotivated and lazy.</p>
<p>And I admit that I feel the same.</p>
<p>I think back to the comments I received when I was younger; the adults back then also commented on my "poor behaviour" and "lack of work ethic". I would disagree with the behaviour assessment unless being reserved was interpreted as being disrespectful, but I would agree that I was definitely less proactive before.</p>
<p>But is that sense of disappointment from the previous generation the same as the sense of disappointment that I feel towards the next generation?</p>
<p>It's tough to say. While I believe there may always be some level of superiority in attitude between generations, I think there has been a significant shift in values in the most recent generations (not including mine, of course!) which leads to a larger gap.</p>
<p>Mainly related to the monetization of attention and everything that implies. Exponential decline, really - it may have been happening in the previous generations but becomes more apparent the further it goes.</p>
<p>Or I've finally become a bitter old man.</p>
