Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=arguing-against-pre-complicating-a-project>arguing against pre-complicating a project</h1>
<p>At work, we started planning a decently sized project where we pull information from all of our services to calculate a daily overall score for users to see.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 or 3 days, I've been saying that we shouldn't make things so complex before we know how these queries would perform, but every single day it seems like they forget what I've said and propose a new cache for a new location.</p>
<p>The first day, we discussed numerous queries that would be hitting our Elasticsearch cluster which doesn't have the best performance. I found it reasonable to break up the several day period into several day long queries whose results were cached in a database by a job on an interval.</p>
<p>The next day they wanted a table in the service aggregating the information from all the other services and a job to populate that table. Caching here seemed reasonable to me, but the table seemed unnecessary since the information would only be needed for a day based on current requirements. I suggested to instead use an in-memory cache which is populated when the information is first requested. I'm not certain what the final decision there was.</p>
<p>The next day they then wanted to add a cache to each individual service and a job to calculate the service specific information, which would then be pulled by the aggregating service. This seemed excessive because for the other services, the information boiled down to basic aggregation sql queries - counting how many things fell under a certain condition mainly. I said that we should see how the simple logic performed first before adding caching and jobs to pre-calculate the information. They don't seem to understand my point and keep pushing for this approach.</p>
<p>I think I'm taking the more sensible path, even if the complex logic is eventually needed. Currently nothing suggests it is, and we'll have to see how it works to know if it needs optimization.</p>
<p>Anyways, that <del>argument</del> discussion has made me really tired this week. If I ever get an interview question for "name a time you had a disagreement with a colleague", I finally have something to use, though the outcome and results are currently unclear.</p>
