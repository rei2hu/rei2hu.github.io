<h1 id=wrangling-with-a-paas-provider>wrangling with a PaaS provider</h1>
<p>I've wanted to write this one for a while but never found the time until now. Dates, quotes, names, and other things are anonymized.</p>
<h2 id=background>background</h2>
<p>One of the projects I've worked on previously was something that's developed for ServiceNow, a platform as a service provider. We had a moderately complex application for healthcare systems management that was used by various organizations. Depending on the customer, was either <em>sideloaded</em> (basically deploying the code to the customer's servers manually) or through the app store.</p>
<h2 id=intro>intro</h2>
<p>One day, I get a dm on Teams that one of our customers, let's call them CU, is having a major problem with one of our application's workflows - they can't close work orders when clicking a button. They were sideloaded so it was possible that something messed up during the upgrade, which was not uncommon. They claimed that there were no recent updates or changes to their system aside from a couple that they determined were not the cause. To semi-quote the initial email on Jan 2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were several other minor updates that is for SecOp VR applicaton, that were non-global changes. The other that is one global property change related to performance issue that is changed as HI suggested, but reverting the property did not fix the problem so it wasn't related either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HI is like ServiceNow's support team or something. It was escalated to engineering (me) after 3 days and I set out to find the problem.</p>
<h2 id=initial-investigation>initial investigation</h2>
<p>For most customer specific issues for our ServiceNow application, we would work on the customer's instance as it was usually caused by some custom configuration that they applied.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting this was interesting as CU made a clone of their production environment to a separate instance that they used for development testing. A support engineer had admin credentials to this instance and we ended up screen sharing where I was basically guiding him to do all the stuff that I would do for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>We were able to confirm the issue on their environment and I started looking at the code - the button made a GlideAjax call (basically a request from client side to call server side code and return the result) but does not receive a proper response. The response should be some xml with an answer attribute, but it was not there and this suggests that the server side code is throwing (and swallowing) an error.</p>
<p>GlideAjax is poorly designed and always returns a 200 with some xml in all scenarios.</p>
<p>Because I've run into this issue before (also why I know what a missing answer attribute means), I tell the support engineer to modify the server side code to wrap the entire function in a try catch so it looked like this</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-29-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-29-1></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">closeThing</span>(<span class=hljs-params>a, b</span>) {
    <span class=hljs-keyword>try</span> {
        <span class=hljs-comment>// ...</span>
    } <span class=hljs-keyword>catch</span> (e) {
        <span class=hljs-keyword>return</span> e;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's ugly but it worked. GlideAjax sets the answer attribute to the stringified version of whatever is returned, even if it's undefined or null (again, great design). After clicking the button to call the upgraded server side code, the answer attribute was there with the value</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-29-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-29-2></label><code>InternalError: Invalid JavaScript value of type com.sun.proxy.$Proxy66
(sys_script_include.someuuidthatisprivate.script; line 10)`.
</code></pre>
<p>What a weird error. We then took the liberty of determining the specific expression that caused the error and it came out to <code>typeof specialVariable</code>.</p>
<p>Would anyone ever expect this code to throw that kind of error? Most likely not. One thing to know is that ServiceNow has it's own special closed source javascript compiler/interpreter and this is where I assume the error is coming from. At this point, I let the support engineer know that this is most likely out of our hands and help him write an email to CU with the root (at least as root as we can go) cause of the issue and to contact ServiceNow if to look deeper into it. What a good days work.</p>
<h2 id=responses>responses</h2>
<p>The day after, we get an email from the a technical lead from CU who was highly skeptical that the error comes from <code>typeof specialVariable</code> because it's native javascript code. But he tested it himself and agrees this was not working, but still did not believe it was the root cause and we had to do more investigation. I ended up putting together what I believe was a minimal working example:</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-29-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-29-3></label><code><span class=hljs-comment>// server</span>
<span class=hljs-keyword>function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">example</span>(<span class=hljs-params></span>) {
    <span class=hljs-keyword>try</span> {
        <span class=hljs-keyword>typeof</span> variable;
    } <span class=hljs-keyword>catch</span> (e) {
        <span class=hljs-keyword>return</span> e;
    }
}

<span class=hljs-comment>// client</span>
<span class=hljs-keyword>var</span> g = <span class=hljs-keyword>new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GlideAjax</span>(<span class=hljs-string>&quot;some_name&quot;</span>);
g.<span class="hljs-title function_">addParam</span>(<span class=hljs-string>&quot;sysparm_name&quot;</span>, <span class=hljs-string>&quot;example&quot;</span>);
g.<span class="hljs-title function_">getXmlAnswer</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class=hljs-property>log</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>and sent it over. I also took the liberty of explaining how ServiceNow's code is what processes all the javascript and the error we're seeing is from them. At this point, we are 2 days in and everything seems to be up to ServiceNow to handle as CU was also engaging ServiceNow support while we investigated the issue. Unfortunately it took their support team 2 weeks to get back to CU and even then they had no real answers - they did not dig deep enough to find what we had found. If I had to put down a few levels of depth, they would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client side code checks response's answer</li>
<li>Client side code receives undefined</li>
<li>Server side code throws an error</li>
<li>Server side code errors at <code>typeof specialVariable</code></li>
</ol>
<p>and ServiceNow support only hit level 1 and suggested updating the condition of an if statement for the client side code. Blegh. CU keeps trying to get someone on the more technical side of ServiceNow while we look at possible temporary remediations.</p>
<h2 id=shooting-in-the-dark-and-a-solution>shooting in the dark and a solution?</h2>
<p>CU sets up another clone of their instance but which is then rolled back and they note that the error is not present there. They are able to demo it to ServiceNow support and they finally admit this is most likely their issue as the code is identical on both instances. At this point it's already February and it's been an entire month since the problem showed up.</p>
<p>At this point I am also back on diagnosing the true root cause, but the problem is that I don't have as much insight into the system as someone who actually works at ServiceNow. I start running scripts I threw together to compare the difference between the instances and there are a ton. Too many to be honest, and flipping things just don't seem to work.</p>
<p>However, a couple of days later, ServiceNow gets back and says that the issue is due to one of the system properties
<code>com.glide.script.interpret.short.expressions.threshold</code> being set to 3800. I haven't read about this one before so I try looking it up, no information. Did I mention ServiceNow documentation is terrible? ServiceNow says it is a known issue, linking to a non-existent or private issue page, and will be fixed in <strong>2 major releases</strong>â€¦ Well, since it was discovered by ServiceNow, I assume they know what they're doing.</p>
<p>7 hours later, the CU technical lead gets back and says the fix didn't work. Meanwhile, we have the temporary fix in place so things are at least working.</p>
<p>I don't know what the suggested fix was, but I end up deciding to test the system property out myself. I set the property on one of our development instances to see if I can reproduce the issue but nothing happens. Turns out, you have to restart the instance for the change to go through, and to restart the instance, you have to contact ServiceNow to restart it manually. Crazy. After 2 or 3 days, I was able to confirm this undocumented property was the cause of the issue as I had to wait for ServiceNow to restart the instance multiple times for things to take effect. We let CU know of this.</p>
<p>At this point, I was excluded from the rest of the email chain as my work was done.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know the reason the property was turned on and had that value? Because of this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other that is one global property change related to performance issue that is changed as HI suggested, but reverting the property did not fix the problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They just had to restart the instance. Interesting to see see HI support turning on a property with known issues.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>conclusion</h2>
<p>Being a good cloud provider requires good support and documentation. ServiceNow has neither of these and that's why I hate it.</p>
