Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX and TikZ diagrams, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=heroku-go-broku>heroku go broku</h1>
<p>A few weeks ago I received an email regarding Heroku discontinuing its free tier. This is quite unfortunate as I think free services like Heroku are great for budding developers. It used to be one of my suggestions for a hosting service when I was helping people with their personal projects as you could get enough hours to run something for the entire month and then some if you had a CC number. Weirdly enough it did seem to get looked down upon by other experienced develpers in that community because they would say "just get a vps from linode or digital ocean" etc etc without understanding the context of what people were looking for, but that's a tangent.</p>
<p>Personally, I had my own project which has a couple thousand users that's been quietly running for the past 5 or so using only free hours and a worker dyno. Unfortunately it's going to shut down November 28th, which is when Heroku will wipe everything. There are numerous alternatives for me to host it but I figure this is a nice time to let that project truly die as I released the source long ago and haven't updated it since.</p>
<p>Again, it's always sad to see a free service go, especially because of (I believe in Heroku's case) abuse. A few bad people ruining things for the rest.</p>
<p>Of course, you could argue that someone like me, utilizing a free service and never planning to pay, falls under that umbrella. But my understanding is that the abuse stemmed from single entities utilizing multiple instances of the free service to do whatever while I used my allowance as a single entity and no more.</p>
