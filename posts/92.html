<h1 id=high-performance-computing-class-1>high performance computing class 1</h1>
<p>One of the classes I'm taking this semester is one on high performance computing. So far, the concepts covered have been a mix of two classes I took during undergrad - computer architecture and operating systems.</p>
<p>From computer architecture, topics being covered include</p>
<ul>
<li>processor design</li>
<li>memory hierarchy/caching</li>
</ul>
<p>And from operating systems there are topics like</p>
<ul>
<li>threads/processes</li>
<li>virtual/physical memory and paging</li>
</ul>
<p>While I do remember most of the high level details from undergrad, the graduate course is more focused on performance implications along with a good heap of historical information. For example, instead of knowing about the memory hierarchy and its components, we specifically go into measuring performance of sample code by hand based on cache hits/misses, clock cycles per instruction, and so on. We also cover the evolution of chip/processor design including things like why frequency has stalled (too much heat) and so on.</p>
<p>Newer topics that I'm remotely familiar with but were not covered during undergrad:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiling</li>
<li>vectorization</li>
<li>loop unrolling</li>
</ul>
<p>Tiling is something I'm familiar with because I've seen the matrix multiplication optimization example before, though I'm not sure from where. I've read about vectorization because I've looked up SIMD before, and similarly for loop unrolling.</p>
<p>We're now going into specific profiling tools and techniques, like the obvious use timers, <code>time</code>, and <code>gprof</code>. We're also covering libraries for basic parallel programming like OpenMP.</p>
<p>Do I think the class has been worth it so far? Yes, as a forward looking statement. While the topics covered so far are things I'm somewhat familiar with, having some guidance on what to cover makes things a lot more streamlined for learning. Furthermore, based on the syllabus, nearly everything in the second half of the semester will be new. There are also resources for filling in whatever gaps of knowledge, like asking the professor, and there are exams which help with making sure I actually understand the topics.</p>
<p>Also access to a high performance computing cluster.</p>
<p>And there's the generic benefit of getting notified of various events. For example, this week I've received like 10 different emails about upcoming talks, and other things.</p>
