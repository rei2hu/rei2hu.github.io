<h1 id=on-my-laptop-usage>on my laptop usage</h1>
<p>So, I've recently picked up a new laptop after breaking my previous one. What did I decide on? A Framework laptop! (wow very hip!)</p>
<h2 id=my-first-laptop>my first laptop</h2>
<p>I'm too lazy to pull up the specs, but I bought my first laptop for highschool and I think it was quite decent with 8GB ram, nvidia graphics card, and even a touch screen! In fact, this laptop still works and I had to fall back to it when setting up my Framework. The only reason I ended up retiring it was because one day as I was crossing the street in University, a speeding truck clipped my backpack which contained the laptop. It ended up messing with the screen hinge somehow and I had trouble opening and closing the laptop. A few weeks in and somehow the screen itself cracked due to pressure put on it by some component when opening the laptop. It was quite annoying to disable the touchscreen when the broken cracked screen simulated constant clicks towards the bottom left of the screen - I was able to disable the driver for it eventually though. I ended up using this laptop for a few more semesters at university until I bought a new one. I'd say I used this for around 4 to 5 years.</p>
<h2 id=my-second-laptop>my second laptop</h2>
<p>My next laptop was also good, specifically it was a gaming laptop with 16GB ram this time and a more recent nvidia graphics card but no touchscreen. This was the laptop I used as my personal for daily for the next few years, up until a few weeks ago. What happened to this one was I accidentally knocked it off and, I assume, the hard disk got screwed - there were some not-so-good noises coming from the area the hdd was located whenever I used it. The last thing I did on that laptop was to export as much data as possible to a USB, but some files were unable to make it off cleanly as I assume certain parts of the disk couldn't be accessed. At least I got the important parts out I'd say. It does suck though because I had recently solved a problem with the cooling and the laptop was powerful to do all the work I needed it to do.</p>
<h2 id=framework-laptop>framework laptop</h2>
<p>So now I needed a new laptop, but fortunately my budget was relatively high compared to the previous two times. I had of course heard of the Framework startup for the longest time and thought the idea was cool, especially as an anti big-tech person. I took a look at their offerings and their catalog was nice and approachable.</p>
<p>The specs looked fine except for the lack of a dedicated gpu, which was important to me as a gamer. Fortunately, I don't play often play the newest games out there or even games at their highest settings - as long as the game can be played and I don't have too many issues then that's fine with me. This used to mean gaming at 20-30 fps but I guess it's now in the 30-60 fps range now.</p>
<p>Looking online, you can find a few comments around the performance of the Iris Xe graphics card which seem to be quite promising for my gaming needs despite being an integrated graphics card. So I went for it - DIY mode.</p>
<p>The one thing that was interesting to me was that all the storage options were SSDs; at university I was taught that SSDs had certain lifetimes due to how they work so I was kind of adverse to using SSDs for main storage but some quick research says they are equally or even more reliable than hdds and usually last at least 5 years (of course that depends on the amount of writing done). Huh, wow, I guess that goes to show you should always figure out the details behind random blanket statements (or maybe just keep yourself updated on whatever). Also the startup and other loading times feel waaaay better than I am used to.</p>
<p>When it came to add-ons I ended up buying a 250GB storage expansion card as one of the modules - there's a blog post out there on Framework that claims the speeds are basically like interal SSDs and purchasing one was also suggested, but at this point I feel like it's been a waste of money so far. I also got a couple of USB-A and USB-C modules which seem to cover my use cases as of yet.</p>
<p>All in all, consideration, purchase, and delivery of the laptop took around 2 weeks, so I was pretty happy.</p>
<p>The actual DIY assembly part of the laptop was decent, but it wasn't really as involved as I hoped it would be; mainly open the laptop, stick some bits in, and close it; granted I would've realized this if I read the DIY guide ahead of time. The nice thing is that I was able to cannibalize a stick of ram from one of my old laptops to use in the framework so I now have 4GB more ram than I would've had originally! I do like the construction of the case as it was simple to open and utilized magnets in addition to screws that aren't fully removable to keep the access panel on - my previous laptops are all held together by like half the original screws because keeping track of what went where was tiring since I opened them up a lot.</p>
<p>After assembly, I had to install an operating system so I went on laptop 1 to set up a Windows 10 bootable drive. I hadn't used that laptop in a while so it was still on Windows 8, and actually force upgraded to Windows 10 when I turned it on and connected it to the internet. This would've been fine except it re-enabled the touch screen functionality and I had to spend hours trying to disable it again. Setting up the laptop with the bootable usb was quick and easy, but I ended realized that some things were not working - turns out the 12th gen chip that the newest laptops have aren't exactly compatible with Windows 10. That's reasonable because the drivers I downloaded were for the 11th gen chips - I just really didn't want to set up a new bootable usb or use Windows 11 because it just didn't seem like a mature enough version to use but caved in the end. One set of updates later, everything does work fine.</p>
<p>I'm not a tech connoisseur so I don't have much criticism on the laptop; it does its job; most qualms I have with it were readily apparent and could have been discovered before purchase. Gaming-wise, it is definitely less performant than my previous laptop, but good enough (or at least for moderately intense scenarios for 10 year old games). I still have plans to set up another OS so perhaps the 250GB module has yet to prove its worth. My conclusion on this purchase is that it's mainly an expensive novelty at the moment, but may demonstrate value later in its lifetime.</p>
