<h1 id=i-enjoy-helping-others-run-my-software>i enjoy helping others run my software</h1>
<p>I've been sitting on this post for a bit, and recently someone did reach out to me for help about running something I was working on so I decided to bash this out now.</p>
<p>There are several smaller private correspondences that I'll skip over, so the first one I'd like to start at is
<a href=https://github.com/rei2hu/MultiplayerPianoKeysScript/issues/1>this somewhat old issue that was made 3 years after I made the repo's last commit</a>.</p>
<p>To give the script a quick backstory, there are apps out there that map computer keyboard keys to piano keys and sites that allow you to "play" piano with other people through this - multiplayerpiano is one of these sites. Unfortunately, their mapping did not match what my friends and I were familiar with, so I made an edit to their script to update itâ€¦ and then added a ton of random features like custom sounds and other things like a good dev.</p>
<p>Because the script relied on the site's original script due to being a copy and paste + modification, when the site updates how it works, the modified script no longer works as it's based on and old version. I do not know how many people were using it between 2017 and 2020, but I'll assume it worked up until then. Considering this, and that the website is bound to update its script in the future, I decided to provide some detailed instructions on generating the script manually in addition to an up-to-date version to compare against for longevity.</p>
<p>But looking at the website now, they have a vastly different setup which is minified and spread across several different files, but also have an unminified version published and editable on GitHub, so the longevity I was aiming for didn't end up being very long. I'm just not sure how it can be hooked into easily without making change requests against the official repository, but could probably figure something out.</p>
<p>There are also several longer correspondences, where the most recent one was related to the hosting of a GMTower server. The backstory for this is that GM(od)Tower was a huge gamemode in Garry's Mod which was eventually shut down/replaced by Tower Unite due to technical constraints blocking more complex development efforts. The developers were supposed to open source the code but hadn't gotten around to it yet (still). Some drama occurred, unofficial servers were hosted, and eventually some code that seemed legitimate was released, so I got my hands on it, made
<a href=https://github.com/touhou-towers>an org and several repositories</a>, hosted a server, and started modding. Well, half a week in and I decided the code was too low quality to work with and gave up but left the repositories public. I do not know if the code is official or if it's some kind of reverse engineered backend; I'd hope it was the latter as it was <em>extrememly</em> terri-bad quality. But it worked.</p>
<p>Cue 3 years later, someone reached out to me through email to figure out how to host a server, as they figured I was able to do it based on how I was actively making changes at the time. I initially approached it lazily, as I thought figuring it out from scratch again would take some time, and only troubleshooted the individual errors sent to me. 2 days in and I decided this was going too slowly and eventually tried setting it up myself - doing so, un-archiving the repository to update the README with instructions, then re-archiving it. Our last email exchange went like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>me: I've updated the README with specific instructions, let me know if they work</p>
<p>them: and then all I have to do is update the MySQL credentials and create the tables?</p>
<p>me: yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was the end.</p>
<p>In all cases, it is nice to know that there are people out there using things I've had a hand in writing - especially since I don't really write with the focus of getting users, but rather just open source things because of the small chance that people can derive some value from my work.</p>
<p>My main gripe would be that there is never really full closure; it seems that after I pass along enough instructions then I never get confirmation whether or not things worked - I assume they are not replying because things <em>did</em> work, but the follow-up confirmation would be nice.</p>
