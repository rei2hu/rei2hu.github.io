<h1 id=no-motivation>no motivation</h1>
<p>I've read in multiple places that once your hobby becomes your job you'll fall out of love, and I always thought that would never be me, but unfortunately it just might be the case.</p>
<p>I haven't written a line of code outside of work for several months. I have a couple things I want to do swimming in my head but I never feel like I have the energy for. Every Sunday I think to myself "Wow the weekend sure was short" and dread going back to work.</p>
<p>In fact, here I am typing up whatever and it's just past Sunday's midnight.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just general burnout, although I haven't been working for very long and I think the general work load is nothing compared to some stuff I had before. Maybe a combination of no energy but a lot of free time is the cause, as back then I was just too busy to have these kinds of thoughts. Maybe the pandemic plays a part, albeit I'm fortunate enough to be very well insulated from the effects it currently has.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagine blowing my brains out - however it's more of a dark humor kind of thought at this point rather than a serious consideration. Am I depressed? Maybe.</p>
<p>I believe the best way to pull myself out is through small but consistent efforts, which is really the reason I'm writing this - as the first small, consistent effort. Just writing makes me feel better. In fact, the first time I kept a journal was a few years ago when I was in a similar mood - that's around the time when some of my first posts were actually written (some are just text copied from back then but their dates are when they were added to this website.)</p>
<p>Hopefully I can keep it up. Might as well catch some zzzs before I have to start work today.</p>
