<h1 id=asking-chatgpt-about-virtual-piano>asking chatgpt about virtual piano</h1>
<p>I was talking with a friend about virtual piano and we decided to ask chatGPT about it.</p>
<p>What is virtual piano? It is software that allows you to play music with just your computer keyboard - hitting a computer key generates a sound, similar to hitting a piano key (I do not play actual piano so I am unfamiliar with other nuances like pedals). There are several implementations of this, and, in general, the main difference between them is the mapping of computer key to piano key to sound. The key layout typically falls under one of these categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Layout 1: shift used for half steps</p>
<ul>

<li><a href=https://virtualpiano.eu/ >https://virtualpiano.eu/</a></li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a lot of sheet music out there, and while notation differs between sheets there is the common rule of spacing, keys, and chords with square brackets. There are various sites that host sheet music transcriptions, tools to help with transcribing, and many other things such as:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Most, if not all, of these websites have sheet music or generate sheet music using layout 1.</p>
<p>Now that you've been introduced to the concept of the virtual piano, let's look at the opening for an arrangement of Pachelbel's Canon in C for layout 1. It's a very common song so it should sound familiar.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-80-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-80-1></label><code>8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w
4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r
[8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w
[4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e [5a] 9 w r
</code></pre>
<p>I'll use the autoplay feature of the first link to play it, but you can use any of the layout 1 links to play along.</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/80/intro.mp4></p>
<p>Sounds nice doesn't it? There is a lot of sheet music out there and I would say this is on the more basic side of things. I'd definitely encourage anyone that may enjoy playing music to try learning virtual piano - all you need are quick fingers and a sense of time. I've spent years practicing it myself (alongside years of resenting having to play violin but that's unrelated).</p>
<p>We were interested in making new sheet music and the topic of asking chatGPT to transcribe songs automatically for us came up. However, before asking, we had a small discussion on whether or not we though it would work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: what if u ask ai to make sheet for u? do u think it could do it</p>
<p>B: no idea!!! probably? since it make normal code…</p>
<p>A: thats because it has many examples to pull from! A: vp piano sheet music is pretty rare..</p>
<p>B: just transformation of note…. transcription!</p>
<p>A: u know how the ai works right, it just puts most likely things together, which is usually correct… outcome is to make sense instead of be right A: anyways thats why im interested in asking about vp!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I'm doubting it while my friend is more optimistic. We decided to ask it to transcribe Canon in C, which we already have sheet music for. Let's see how it goes:</p>
<p><img alt="asking chatgpt to make sheet music directly" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt1.png></p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-80-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-80-2></label><code>X: 1
T: Canon in D
C:Johann Pachelbel
M: 4/4
L: 1/8
K:D
|:A | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 |
| G2 G2 F2 E2 | F2 E2 D4 | A2 F2 D2 B,2 | C4 A2 A2 |
| D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 |
| G2 G2 F2 E2 | F2 E2 D4 | A2 F2 D2 B,2 | A4 |]
</code></pre>
<p>We opened with a direct question without any context - this didn't go too well. The result is a <code>makefile</code> (what?), has the title "Canon in D", and the entire thing doesn't make sense in the context of any virtual piano we were familiar with. Our only guess is M is the time signature, 4/4 time, and the letter and number combinations are note and octave values. I would later figure out what this was, and it will be covered at the end.</p>
<p>How about we provide them with the first eight bars?</p>
<p><img alt="providing the first eight bars" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt2.png></p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-80-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-80-3></label><code>3 5 2 1 0 2 3 5 | 2 4 0 1 7 0 6 5 |
1 0 2 3 5 3 2 1 | 4 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 |
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, now we get a series of numbers back, this seems more legitimate. What does it sound like?</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/80/attempt3.mp4></p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not correct either. If you're familiar with the key layout, you can notice that the steps between <code>8</code> and <code>w</code> are much more than the steps between <code>3</code> and <code>5</code>, suggesting this is incorrect without playing it.</p>
<p>Let's try again and give it more bars:</p>
<p><img alt="providing more bars" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt3.png></p>
<p>Those are the correct notes! But does it understand where the notes come from or did it just repeat what we fed it? Let's ask it for more:</p>
<p><img alt="asking for the next lines" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt4.png></p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-80-4 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-80-4></label><code>[8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w
[4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e [5a] 9 w r
[2o] y [8t] w [5r] 9 [6p] t [0o] 8 [9i] u [5y] t r
[2o] y [7r] w [4y] e [5r] 9 [1i] q e [2o] y [3a] w
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to have caught on to the format; could this be correct? Let's take a listen!</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/80/attempt4.mp4></p>
<p>It started out well (though the first two lines are copies of what was provided) and then goes wrong. At least it doesn't sound too bad, if incorrect. Let's give it more lines and see if it can figure things out:</p>
<p><img alt="providing even more lines" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt5.png>
<img alt="telling it off for copying the lines we gave" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt6.png></p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-80-5 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-80-5></label><code>[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it came up with a line and repeated it 3 times. The lines look like they will sound similar to what it tried before <code>[2o] y</code> and <code>[2os] y</code>. This doesn't look correct but let's listen…</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/80/attempt5.mp4></p>
<p><img alt="getting repeated answer" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt7.png></p>
<p>Another attempt makes it repeat itself. Perhaps it decided to repeat itself when it heard that Canon is repetitive? We've given up at this point so we instead ask it if it is familiar with virtual piano, which it seems to not be.</p>
<p><img alt="asking if its familiar with virtual piano" src=/blobs/80/chatgpt8.png></p>
<p>Great, it finally admits it does not know what its doing. I'm also not sure what the second paragraph is saying - was it generating a different notation that software out there supports? Or was it telling us to find something that could understand the virtual piano notation (under the assumption that we did not understand the format ourselves?) I'm not sure.</p>
<p>But wait, what about the notation it showed us initially - what is that? A search online shows that this is
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation>abc notation</a>. I'm unfamiliar with this notation, but fortunately there are tools online that should be able to generate sounds from this notation. And it sounds like…</p>
<audio controls>
<source src=/blobs/80/maybe-canon-in-d.wav type=audio/wav>
</audio>
<p>:(. These questions were asked around September 29, 2023.</p>
<p>There are many possible arrangements for Canon in (key), but unfortunately chatGPT was unable to provide any of them. The topic must be too niche for it to have much data on to even create sheet music for a well known song. We were planning to ask it to generate sheet music for various songs if it could handle this, but that was not the case.</p>
<p>The full version of this sheet music is below, though there are many many other versions that are valid. You can try playing it yourself, though I would not use the autoplayer because it cannot handle tempo as well as a human playing - spacing between notes and other symbols which I've omitted for simplicity play a part in timing.</p>

<p>Here's a video of it; I've replaced spaces with periods because the autoplay uses periods for longer pauses.</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/80/full.mp4></p>
<p>Overall, this just reinforces my <a href=/posts/59>position on ai</a> - if you're aiming for correctness, you must double check the output because it can't be trusted. Even though there are many stories and examples of ai generating code, solving math problems, and performing other amazing feats, I just cannot bring myself to blindly use it. In fact, this kind of sheet music generation can be straightforward and logical by taking simple music files like MIDIs or existing sheet music and doing a direct translation into virtual piano's notation. If these LLMs are generating answers by learning rules and solving problems then this should have been possible. Perhaps a very detailed explanation of the key to sound mapping followed by questioning would work; it has not been tried yet.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Naturally, I&#x27;m doubting it while my friend is more optimistic. We decided to ask</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it to transcribe Canon in C, which we already have sheet music for. Let&#x27;s see</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+how it goes:</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+We opened with a direct question without any context - this didn&#x27;t go too well.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The result is a `makefile` (what?), has the title &quot;Canon in D&quot;, and the entire</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+thing doesn&#x27;t make sense in the context of any virtual piano we were familiar</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with. Our only guess is M is the time signature, 4/4 time, and the letter and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+number combinations are note and octave values. I would later figure out what</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this was, and it will be covered at the end.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+How about we provide them with the first eight bars?</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Ok, now we get a series of numbers back, this seems more legitimate. What does</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Unfortunately this is not correct either. If you&#x27;re familiar with the key</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+layout, you can notice that the steps between `8` and `w` are much more than the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+steps between `3` and `5`, suggesting this is incorrect without playing it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Let&#x27;s try again and give it more bars:</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Those are the correct notes! But does it understand where the notes come from or</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+It started out well (though the first two lines are copies of what was provided)</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Another attempt makes it repeat itself. Perhaps it decided to repeat itself when</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it heard that Canon is repetitive? We&#x27;ve given up at this point so we instead</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ask it if it is familiar with virtual piano, which it seems to not be.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Great, it finally admits it does not know what its doing. I&#x27;m also not sure what</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the second paragraph is saying - was it generating a different notation that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+software out there supports? Or was it telling us to find something that could</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+understand the virtual piano notation (under the assumption that we did not</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+understand the format ourselves?) I&#x27;m not sure.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+But wait, what about the notation it showed us initially - what is that? A</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+search online shows that this is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+[abc notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation). I&#x27;m unfamiliar with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this notation, but fortunately there are tools online that should be able to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+generate sounds from this notation. And it sounds like...</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+:(. These questions were asked around September 29, 2023.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There are many possible arrangements for Canon in (key), but unfortunately</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+chatGPT was unable to provide any of them. The topic must be too niche for it to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+have much data on to even create sheet music for a well known song. We were</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+planning to ask it to generate sheet music for various songs if it could handle</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this, but that was not the case.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The full version of this sheet music is below, though there are many many other</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+versions that are valid. You can try playing it yourself, though I would not use</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the autoplayer because it cannot handle tempo as well as a human playing -</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spacing between notes and other symbols which I&#x27;ve omitted for simplicity play a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+part in timing.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Overall, this just reinforces my [position on ai](/posts/59) - if you&#x27;re aiming</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for correctness, you must double check the output because it can&#x27;t be trusted.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Even though there are many stories and examples of ai generating code, solving</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+math problems, and performing other amazing feats, I just cannot bring myself to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+blindly use it. In fact, this kind of sheet music generation can be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+straightforward and logical by taking simple music files like MIDIs or existing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+sheet music and doing a direct translation into virtual piano&#x27;s notation. If</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+these LLMs are generating answers by learning rules and solving problems then</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this should have been possible. Perhaps a very detailed explanation of the key</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to sound mapping followed by questioning would work; it has not been tried yet.</span>
