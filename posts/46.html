<h1 id=personal-yearly-reflection-2>personal yearly reflection 2</h1>
<p>Can't believe it's been a year since I wrote the last one. I don't have any preplanned format for these yet, but I guess it's best to take a look over some of what I wrote last year.</p>
<h2 id=recap>recap</h2>
<h3 id=remote-work>remote work</h3>
<p>Remote work is now the norm. I used to get up at 7am to get to work at 9am. Nowadays I wake up at 7am - 8am to start work at 8am (which is my own appointed start time). The best part is that the time before work is spent relaxing nowadays compared to previously where I'd be commuting to work.</p>
<p>I think the largest boons of remote work are the lack of commute and the fact that I'm in a personal space while working. This means I can do things I couldn't normally do in an office because I'm actually at home, and in general I'm just pretty comfortable here.</p>
<h3 id=seniority>seniority</h3>
<p>I still find myself as an early mid level engineer. I think my attitude towards technology has changed somewhat - if you knew me maybe 2 or more years ago, you'd know that I was constantly teaching myself the next cool thing but nowadays I just read about them and focus on improving the skills necessary for my day job.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm still in a mentoring position, specifically because I own a nice chunk of code at work so people will come to be when they have questions making their own changes or when working with similar tools that were used for that code since I'm pretty experienced with it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I've entered a position where I do more code reviews and chatting than writing code. That's both good and bad, as it means I'm more experienced at picking out various issues but am also losing out on the ability to write code on the fly - for example I can barely write Java without the help of an ide. I'm not too worried yet though because I still have other things I can pull out without an issue.</p>
<p>Communication… I don't know if I can make a call on this. I think it's better than before but mainly because my main form of communication is text through Teams or Slack. This might also explain the approachability change.</p>
<h3 id=product>product</h3>
<p>Huh, funny how I made all these complaints back then. In fact, I heard that the project was scrapped which means its likely all my concerns were justified. It is possible that it was scrapped for reasons I didn't complain about, but I don't have the insider information on why.</p>
<h3 id=free-time>free time</h3>
<p>Less projects, less games, less everything.</p>
<p>I did take to exercising regularly by running/stretching on alternate days but on-call ruined that schedule. One week of on-call meant one week of "running" indoors (running in place, I don't have a treadmill) which definitely did not measure up to running outdoors as the week after I realized my stamina was killed. So that habit was quickly dropped; moreso when it got cold and running outside gave me a headache. I do still keep up with exercise, but I mainly do a series of planks/crunches/pushups/running in place/jumping jacks for approximately 20 minutes every morning a couple hours into work (hooray for wfh).</p>
<p>My other consistent habit is practicing a few foreign languages, namely Spanish and Chinese. I've just hit a 75 day streak in Duolingo and am going strong. I was originally alternating between the languages per day but realized it's probably better to just focus on one, so I picked Spanish. Write now I have 98 crowns in Spanish and I seem to do on average one per day, so I should be at 450 or so by the next reflection if I keep it up.</p>
<p>Outside of those two things, I mainly read articles on HN and other sites; admittedly I like to focus on discourse in the comment sections more than the articles.</p>
<p>Have I had a serious programming project over the last year? Not really. Just mainly play around type things that I can't be bothered to write about.</p>
<p>Ah, actually I did start listening to a podcast called Software Engineer Radio which I find pretty informative - it covers a wide variety of topics and I just skip things I'm not interested in. I've been listening to it backwards and have just hit episode 405 which seems to be another infrastructure as code episode so I'll be listening to that. I'm not sure how much of the talks I'm actually absorbing and how much is in one ear and out the other, but then again that's how a lot of information goes for me nowadays - I don't go for hard memorization but rather just exposure to a topic so I can deep dive later when wanted.</p>
<h3 id=last-years-goal-summary>last year's goal summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Exercise - moderate daily exercise</li>
<li>Drink water - used to with heavy exercise, not so much anymore</li>
<li>Sleep on time - great bedtime nowadays</li>
<li>New job - discussion topic</li>
<li>Grad school - discussion topic</li>
<li>Improve networking - maybe</li>
<li>Improve communication - discussed</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=blog-stats>blog stats</h3>
<p>Last year I wrote approximately 15 posts (note that the initial 12 posts are actually lifted from a separate blog I kept). This year I wrote 17, which is a similar amount. The largest change between this and last year is the category of topic that I wrote about. Last year was mainly technical, but this year I typed around 5 posts on my personal life. I actually like this trend, so I'll probably keep it up.</p>
<p>Another interesting observation is that all of the year's posts are grouped up between July and December. There seems to be a sort of dry spell in the first half of the year for some reason. Looking back, it does seem pretty straightforward - the first year's gap was because this blog didn't exist then and this year's gap is because of my poor mental state.</p>
<p>I also think I'm going to avoid the errata post because I'm lazy and just try to improve the initial quality by proofreading at least once before committing. Staritng enxt yaer tohugh, I'm too lzay to go thruogh thnigs fro now.</p>
<h3 id=pandemic>pandemic</h3>
<p>I can't even remember if this is year 1 or year 2 of the pandemic. I think this is year 2, mainly because I believe the 19 in Covid-19 stands for 2019, although it must've been late 2019 which is why it isn't 3 years. Who knows how this will turn out - new variant just popped up and all that. I feel like it's going to become endemic because people just aren't willing to play it safe.</p>
<p>I'm aware I had a sudden shift in my thoughts some a little under half a year ago and I think it is caused by isolation which results from remote work and other stay at home practices and various ongoing events. I would say depression but I don't want to appropriate that label just in case what I was feeling doesn't actually qualify.</p>
<p>Anyways, it's like I said a million times before, I'm feeling lonely which is something that I haven't felt for most of my life. Lonely enough to try to strike up a conversation with random people I haven't spoken to in years (with minimal results). Lonely enough to browse around various friend finder apps. But not lonely enough to compromise my privacy by submitting personal data to actually get on those platforms. The apps have less than minimal results, but that's probably because of my privacy restrictions.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I'd like to note is the effect that music has had on my psyche. For a certain amount of time I listened to strictly instrumental songs, then I started listening to songs with vocals in the 2010-2015 range which made me feel extra lonely - a blast from the past I guess. But then I realized it was really just any song with certain kinds of vocals. Anyways this feels too personal to write about so I'll change topics here.</p>
<h3 id=new-professional-project>new professional project</h3>
<p>I say new project because this might be a different project at the same company or a different project at a different company and I don't want to out myself. I see that I wanted to tackle something highly technical and I thought this would be it, but unfortunately it just isn't. It's a standard CRUD app but there is one interesting part of the architecture which was already completed by the time I joined. We might be hitting some scaling issues so maybe I'll get my wish though. I mainly do frontend because of my js/ts experience but also do small backend work when backend needs to pick up slack on some of the features I work on.</p>
<p>On the other hand I did get a couple of people who reached out to me about new opportunities, one I've written about before which is still ongoing (?… might've ended in a ghosting before setting up the final interview but we'll see, naturally I'll update that post eventually) and another one today. I don't have any kind of LinkedIn or anything out there so you may wonder who it was from. It is in fact from that senior engineer that left for a startup I mentioned last year and the opportunity is for that startup. Guess I networked properly after all, haha. This is also how I know the previous project got scrapped, as that is the first thing he brought up when he emailed me.</p>
<p>One curiosity is how I just feel happy when someone reaches out whether it be for a casual conversation or other reason. Probably a result of the observations I've made in the last section.</p>
<h3 id=grad-school>grad school</h3>
<p>Applied to a two grad schools, one accepted, one no response. Which is weird because I paid ~\$80 to be ghosted by a grad school? I ended up not opting to do the program I was accepted to though because I became disillusioned with the state of education - namely that the most valuable thing to other people will be the label you can apply to yourself for earning a masters at X University rather than the things you've learned.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just searched the things online and learned them there for free - there are various open courses that you can take advantage of at your own pace. Went over databases/networking and advanced algorithms. How much stuff am I able to recall? Almost nothing, however some of the Software Engineering radio episodes cover these topics and when they say something I'm often like "oh yeah, I remember reading about this". Great!</p>
<h3 id=new-goals>new goals</h3>
<p>So what will my new goals be? I haven't thought of any way to consolidate last years with this years. Maybe I'll keep unattained goals for 2 years or something at most after which I can replace them, seems good for a start.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that some of these goals are one shot while others are consistent things I'm trying to build a habit out of, so the only things that can be removed would be those one shot goals I've attained.</p>
<p>Well, at the end it's up to me so I don't have to follow any set of rules religiously. I've decided to organize the list in the following way: this years goals, previously missed goals, and finally previous habitual goals. I just need to hope that the list doesn't grow too long, but at least it's organized in order of recency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fix acne<ul>
<li>Something about staying at home all day gave me a mild case of acne which I ignored. Now it's not so mild (or at least I'd like to think so). I should probably do something about it.</li></ul></li>
<li>Solo trip somewhere<ul>
<li>I don't know, but I think I need to go out and about, and preferably on my own. Not to go blow my brains out in the mountains so no one finds me (dark joke sorry)</li></ul></li>
<li>Work on social issues/volunteering<ul>
<li>I used to volunteer a lot back in university. Mainly stuff like tutoring/planting stuff/cleaning up areas. Not sure if environmental issues fall under the umbrella of social issues but I'd like to work on that, or volunteer in a teaching capacity. Well outside of those activities I can write software although I fail to see the exact use for that skill without domain expertise. The main reason I don't volunteer nowadays is because organization is annoying. I'm sure there are organizations that can do the main organizing work while I do my thing, I'd just need to find them.</li></ul></li>
<li>Set up some solid relationships<ul>
<li>I need a solid friend circle. Could be real life or online, platonic or romantic. I don't know. I'd estimate myself to have 1 close friend right now and a handful of people in the 0-0.5 range which I wouldn't count as being in my inner friend circle.</li></ul></li>
<li>Drink water (2020)</li>
<li>Improve networking (2020)</li>
<li>Improve verbal communication (2020)</li>
<li>Exercise (habitual)</li>
<li>Sleep on time (habitual)</li>
</ol>

<span class=hljs-addition>+before setting up the final interview but we&#x27;ll see, naturally I&#x27;ll update that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+post eventually) and another one today. I don&#x27;t have any kind of LinkedIn or anything</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out there so you may wonder who it was from. It is in fact from that senior engineer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that left for a startup I mentioned last year and the opportunity is for that startup.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Guess I networked properly after all, haha. This is also how I know the previous</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+project got scrapped, as that is the first thing he brought up when he emailed me.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+One curiosity is how I just feel happy when someone reaches out whether it be for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a casual conversation or other reason. Probably a result of the observations I&#x27;ve</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+made in the last section.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### grad school</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Applied to a two grad schools, one accepted, one no response. Which is weird because</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I paid ~$80 to be ghosted by a grad school? I ended up not opting to do the program</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I was accepted to though because I became disillusioned with the state of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+education - namely that the most valuable thing to other people will be the label</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+you can apply to yourself for earning a masters at X University rather than the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+things you&#x27;ve learned.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Anyways, I just searched the things online and learned them there for free - there</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+are various open courses that you can take advantage of atyour own pace. Went over</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+databases/networking and advanced algorithms. How much stuff am I able to recall?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Almost nothing, however some of the Software Engineering radio episodes cover these</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+topics and when they say something I&#x27;m often like &quot;oh yeah, I remember reading about</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this&quot;. Great!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### new goals</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+So what will my new goals be? I haven&#x27;t thought of any way to consolidate last years</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with this years. Maybe I&#x27;ll keep unattained goals for 2 years or something at most</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+after which I can replace them, seems good for a start.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+One interesting thing to note is that some of these goals are one shot while others</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+are consistent things I&#x27;m trying to build a habit out of, so the only things that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+can be removed would be those one shot goals I&#x27;ve attained.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, at the end it&#x27;s up to me so I don&#x27;t have to follow any set of rules religiously.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;ve decided to organize the list in the following way: this years goals, previously</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+missed goals, and finally previous habitual goals. I just need to hope that the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+list doesn&#x27;t grow too long, but at least it&#x27;s organized in order of recency:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Fix acne</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - Something about staying at home all day gave me a mild case of acne which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      I ignored. Now it&#x27;s not so mild (or at least I&#x27;d like to think so). I should</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      probably do something about it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Solo trip somewhere</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - I don&#x27;t know, but I think I need to go out and about, and preferably on my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      own. Not to go blow my brains out in the mountains so no one finds me (dark</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      joke sorry)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Work on social issues/volunteering</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - I used to volunteer a lot back in university. Mainly stuff like tutoring/planting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      stuff/cleaning up areas. Not sure if environmental issues fall under the umbrella</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      of social issues but I&#x27;d like to work on that, or volunteer in a teaching capacity.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      Well outside of those activities I can write software although I fail to see</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      the exact use for that skill without domain expertise. The main reason I don&#x27;t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      volunteer nowadays is because organization is annoying. I&#x27;m sure there are</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      organizations that can do the main organizing work while I do my thing, I&#x27;d</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      just need to find them.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+4. Set up some solid relationships</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - I need a solid friend circle. Could be real life or online, platonic or romantic.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d estimate myself to have 1 close friend right now and a handful</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      of people in the 0-0.5 range which I wouldn&#x27;t count as being in my inner friend</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      circle.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+5. Drink water (2020)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+6. Improve networking (2020)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+7. Improve verbal communication (2020)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+8. Exercise (habitual)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+9. Sleep on time (habitual)</span>
