<h1 id=simplex-method-1>simplex method 1</h1>
<p>In a small deviation from the previous educational content which covered things I learned during graduate studies, I decided to write about something I learned during an undergrad class called "Optimization".</p>
<p>Let's say we're farming in a game, and we have a choice between two areas $l_x$ and $l_y$. When farming $l_x$, we can receive 23 gold per hour, and when farming $l_y$ we can receive 12 gold per hour. On this alone, it makes sense to spend all our time farming $l_x$.</p>
<p>Now, pretend you have to complete a number of objectives in the game so that you can receive an (unrelated but much more rewarding) weekly reward that you MUST achieve. The reason $l_x$ gives more gold per hour is because there are less objectives - say 2 per hour compared to $l_y$'s 3 per hour. Depending on how many objectives you need to be complete, and how much time you have to spend this week, the optimal way to farm can change.</p>
<p>Also imagine farming each zone requires certain resources $r_1$ and $r_2$ per hour. For example 1 hour of farming $l_x$ takes 5 $r_1$ and 20 $r_2$ while $l_y$ takes 10 and 5 respectively. Again, depending on how much $r_1$ and $r_2$ you have, the optimal farming distribution is not obvious.</p>
<p>To fully realize this scenario, we'll come up with concrete numbers for the constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>24 hours of farming (maximum)</li>
<li>40 objectives completed (at least)</li>
<li>200 units of $r_1$</li>
<li>300 units of $r_2$</li>
</ol>
<p>This leaves us with the set of inequalities</p>
<p>$$ \begin{aligned} x + y &\leq 24 \\ 2x + 3y &\geq 40 \\ 5x + 10y &\leq 200 \\ 20x + 5y &\leq 300 \end{aligned} $$</p>
<p>$$ x \geq 0, y \geq 0 $$</p>
<p>Where $x$ and $y$ are the hours spent farming locations $l_x$ and $l_y$. Plotting these inequalities shows the location of solutions to the scenario i.e. the feasible region.</p>
<p><img alt="feasible region" src=/blobs/137/feasible.png></p>
<p>If the colors are not clear, it's the section that contains the point (4, 14). Now we have to determine which point in this area maximizes the equation $23x + 12y$.</p>
<p>However, before figuring that out, let's go back to the simpler problem where there was only one constraint - the hours per week (and at least 0 hours in each area).</p>
<p><img alt="feasible region for hours only" src=/blobs/137/single.png></p>
<p>Intuitively, we knew that it was best to spent all of our farming time on $l_x$ was the best because it gave a higher gold per hour. By looking at this feasible region, it should make sense that the optimal solution is somewhere on the lines of the inequalities otherwise we would not be utilizing all hours available. Similarly, it will never be in the middle of the line (with one exception) because being there only shifts the answer partways to a maximum or minimum.</p>
<p>Look at the points (24, 0), (12, 12) and (0, 24). In our case, either $l_x$ or $l_y$ is better, so using (12, 12) does not make any sense when we can improve our values by either moving to fully farming $l_x$ or $l_y$. The one case where it does make sense is if $l_x$ and $l_y$ are equally rewarding, which implies that <em>any</em> point on the line gives an optimal solution; (24, 0), (1, 23), …, (24, 0). If the implicit $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ constraints didn't exist, then it could even make sense to go even further to something like (n, 24 - n) where $n$ approaches infinity.</p>
<p>Now, going back to the original problem, with this new intuition, we now know that the optimal solution should occur at the ends of the constraint lines, barring the one special case. This is known as the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_linear_programming>Fundamental theorem of linear programming</a>
(which I was unaware of was a thing until I decided to write this)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mathematical optimization, the fundamental theorem of linear programming states, in a weak formulation, that the maxima and minima of a linear function over a convex polygonal region occur at the region's corners. Further, if an extreme value occurs at two corners, then it must also occur everywhere on the line segment between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="feasible region with corners" src=/blobs/137/points.png></p>
<p>Since we know that the optimal occurs and a corner, then we can look at our feasible region and test and check each point, to find a solution. What are the points? (0, 20), (8, 16), (12, 12), (14, 4), (0, 13.3).</p>
<p>When we plug those values into the original equation $23x + 12y$, it turns out that (12, 12) gives the maximum of 420 gold, followed by (8, 16) with 376 gold, and (14, 4) with 370. The minimum is at (0, 13.3) if you accept 13.3 as a valid play time, giving approximately 160 gold while satisfying the weekly objective count.</p>
<p>We can also plug these values into the original constraints to see which it hit: For (12, 12)</p>
<p>$$ \begin{aligned} 12 + 12 &\leq 24 \\ 2(12) + 3(12) &\geq 40 \\ 5(12) + 10(12) &\leq 200 \\ 20(12) + 5(12) &\leq 300 \end{aligned} $$</p>
<p>We used up all of our 300 $r_2$ resource.</p>
<p>Is this visual graph and test/check approach the main way to do this? Definitely not - in this case we had two variables so we were able to plot this, but in the real world there could be hundreds which would be a mess to visualize if even possible. Instead, we can take the concept of moving along edges to corners of the feasible region and do things numerically.</p>
