Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX and TikZ diagrams, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=learning-haskell>learning haskell</h1>
<p>I've decided to go ahead and learn a new programming language - and not one that is similar to most other oop languages - Haskell. I have dabbled in it here and there thanks to influences from other people I hang around with but I've never really gotten into it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Functional - I've come to appreciate functional programming</li>
<li>No boilerplate - a lot of the Haskell code I've seen does away with a lot of boilerplate that you can find in other languages.</li>
<li>Statically typed</li>
<li>Sound smart</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, because I don't know much about Haskell right now, I cannot give a solid list of reasons. So I guess if I wanted to give reasons for learning Haskell, I would have to learn about it first. Quite interesting.</p>
<p>Also it gives me something to write about, and I don't want to write about work for now.</p>
<p>I've read up to the Modules chapter in <code>learnyouahaskell</code>. So far, everything has been a refresher but it was good to re-experience the syntax again. I'll actually focus on restyling this page now because it looks ugly to me. And I don't usually care much for appearances.</p>
<p>But before I go, I'd like to point out that I've already come across a case where Haskell does away with boilerplate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>make a new list where each element is the sum of the previous elements. For example, <code>[3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3] =&gt; [3, 6, 8, 11, 15, 18]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an oop language you might find something like this</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-4-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-4-1></label><code><span class=hljs-type>int</span>[] events = [<span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>2</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>4</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>];
<span class=hljs-type>int</span>[] summed = <span class=hljs-keyword>new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[events.length];
summed[<span class=hljs-number>0</span>] = events[<span class=hljs-number>0</span>];
<span class=hljs-keyword>for</span> (<span class=hljs-type>int</span> <span class=hljs-variable>i</span> <span class=hljs-operator>=</span> <span class=hljs-number>1</span>; i &lt; events.length; i++) {
    summed[i] = summed[i - <span class=hljs-number>1</span>] + events[i];
}
</code></pre>
<p>For Haskell you could do this</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-4-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-4-2></label><code><span class=hljs-title>let</span> events = [<span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>2</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>, <span class=hljs-number>4</span>, <span class=hljs-number>3</span>] <span class=hljs-keyword>in</span> scanl1 (+) events
</code></pre>
<p>The existence of various built in methods that don't appear in other languages are great.</p>
