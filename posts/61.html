<h1 id=fake-expertise>fake expertise</h1>
<p>I have a colleague who has a lot of YOE and is very vocal about things. For a while, I figured he was very knowledgable on numerous topics and always took his words for granted because they seemed plausible, but recently he made some claims about things in my area of expertise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the things he said were just entirely wrong - not even outdated or slightly off. Even when I present some evidence to contradict or ask for more details he would just not respond (this is over Slack). I don't think we have the best working relationshipâ€¦</p>
<p>Anyways, now I'm second guessing everything that he's said so far so there's that.</p>
