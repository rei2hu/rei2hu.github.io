<h1 id=i-am-a-master>i am a master</h1>
<p>Is that what people with master's degrees call themselves? People with doctorates get called doctor and have a dr. prefix, so surely people with masters' can call themselves masters and have a… mr… prefix… That's what mr. stands for, right? Master?</p>
<p>All jokes aside, I feel quite accomplished; I set my mind (and money) to a one year commitment and was able to follow through. Technically I haven't graduated yet since there are 3 weeks left, but I have high enough scores in my current class to pass without doing anything else.</p>
<p>The real question is if I'll keep grinding for A's this semester, lean back and relax, or make some half-assed effort to finish the remaining assignments. Who knows?</p>
<h2 id=actually-finished>actually finished</h2>
<p><img alt="man breaking chains meme" src=/blobs/130/chains.png></p>
<p>Well, there's still one week but I've taken the time to finish the rest of the work ahead of time and for a not-terrible grade, so there really is nothing left for me to do but wait.</p>
<p>And I don't think it could have come at a better time. To be honest, my motivation has slowly faded away since last semester, and I have been procrastinating a lot. In my first semester, I remembered always working ahead by at least 1 week and even reviewing material weekly. Nowadays, I've been either on pace or behind and don't even review outside of the week before exams.</p>
<h3 id=classes>classes</h3>
<p>The top 3 classes for me were high performance computing, distributed systems, and advanced bayesian modeling based on my personal criteria: informative, engaging, and challenging.</p>
<p>This semester, the only class I had was advanced bayesian modeling and I think it was great. There was a lot of theory in the lectures while most of the projects involved real-world application e.g. taking a dataset and running various analyses on them. The exams were also non-trivial; it required actual understanding of the material.</p>
<p>In fact, that's something that I've kind of noticed about math and computer science in general. In pre-university level courses, exams typically focus on picking a formula out of several to use and applying them. These formulas are not something derived during the exam but are rather something given in the lectures. These kinds of exams also continue into the first few years of university level courses in my experience; I remember doing this for classes like calculus iii, linear algebra, and even statistics - these are all non-senior level courses. Only when I took senior and post-graduate level courses like numerical differential equations, applied algebra, and advanced bayesian modeling did question become more conceptual or theoretical.</p>
<p>And that's for math specifically. For computer science, I think it's more topic dependent, as I've had a mix of plug and chug exams and conceptual understanding exams in both low-level and post-graduate classes. Sometimes you have to just run an algorithm you learned in class manually, and sometimes there's some theoretical question like how can you improve something or what changes with a certain change in an algorithm (though sometimes those are topics covered during lectures).</p>
<p>To be frank, the conceptual understanding exam is the main reason I've lost points in advanced bayesian modeling this semester, but I think those losses were well deserved, and getting things wrongs lets me know where I need to improve my understanding. And I lived by the curve (not really, but I would have lost another 4-5 points off my overall grade if there was no curve).</p>
<h3 id=proctoru>ProctorU</h3>
<p>I had 2 proctoru proctored exams this semester, and a total of 5 proctoru proctored exams through the program. I still don't think it's a good service but I felt like updating my opinions about it. I think I talked some trash about proctoru as far as effectiveness before; let me see if I can find it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll also say I don't think it would be very hard to cheat despite the checks</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not cheat, but as I did the dance I thought of several holes that could be exploited.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There it is. So the first observation I previously made was that I always had an earbud in because that's how I listen to computer audio. In the past semesters, this was never called out but I was actually asked to remove them this semester. Ironically, this led to a scenario where during an exam the proctor disconnected and a technician was trying to contact me through my speakers but I couldn't hear them.</p>
<p>When a proctor does disconnect early for some reason, you end up having to do some relatively shady actions (visit non-proctoru website, download and run program) to continue the session. From my perspective, it was pretty suspicious and also not ideal because I had to perform the recovery steps while my exam timer was running.</p>
<p>There are other things like the environment only being 360 scanned once at the beginning that should make it easy to cheat, though, because I didn't cheat, I don't know how effective they are at detecting cheating afterwards. In my first exam, I had a cup on my table and was asked to move it far away which I did. This required me to get up, move, and sit back down, and they did not ask to rescan anything. There's also variability in how proctors evaluate out of places items. In addition to the first earbuds scenario, this semester, during my first exam, I left my egpu on my desk and the proctor for that session asked no questions about it. Meanwhile, the proctor for my second exam did ask about it, but let me leave it up when I explained it's an egpu and I also used it to charge my laptop.</p>
<p>I still think the general workflow as a test taker is relatively smooth, and I had no trouble outside of the one disconnection this semester. While I would attempt to avoid exams that require proctoru just because of privacy and convenience reasons, I don't think it's as horrible as its past reputation makes it out to be.</p>
<h3 id=projects>projects</h3>
<p>I actually liked most of the project/programming assignment in the program. I guess that while I like conceptual exams, I like applicable(?) activities or activities where I apply concepts.</p>
<p>Tiled gas simulators and financial simulations run in high performance computing clusters, distributed key value stores with failure handling, lexers and parsers for custom grammars, adversarial machine learning programs and encryption/decryption algorithms, ray tracing and mesh rendering and vector visualizations, and a lot of bayesian data analyses. These projects were definitely the highlight of the program for me, and if working on stuff like this was my job, then I would be a lot happy(ier)… at least for a few years.</p>
<p>Some of the projects came with a paper requirement, of which most were fine except for the last bayesian analysis which required some actual exposition on topic of the dataset being analyzed. I didn't hate it though, it's just not very related to the class content but it matched the format of various academic papers we read in class.</p>
<p>There were definitely projects that I did not like that took the format of guided tutorials. Again, I didn't hate them but it just was not the kind of work I expected in a master's program, and they were all for content that I was already familiar with so those projects/activities felt more like chores and busywork.</p>
<p>And then there were presentations; some live and some recorded. All I can say is that my jaw gets tired after 5 minutes of straight talking. Funnily enough, I actually spent more time on recorded presentations because I would keep re-recording audio to stitch together every time I tripped up, and that happens a lot (I'm not a good speaker). In live presentations, I would just push forward after a mistake.</p>
<h3 id=llm-usage>llm usage</h3>
<p>The number of times I saw someone saying they asked ai or had a conversation with an llm about a class topic was… pretty high. And the actual usage was pretty worrying.</p>
<p>For example, in the security class I took where no one knew what was going to be on the final or how it was going to be structured, someone went ahead and generated a multiple-choice exam with some kind of llm and shared in with the class. On top of the exam including content that was never covered in the course (fair, considering that's how the midterm was), a large portion of the questions had choices of which all were wrong or multiple options could be correct (in my opinion). Furthermore there was no answer key to check against so I'm not sure how useful the mock exam actually was (spoiler: it was not useful at all). That post actually received the most number of upvotes I've ever seen in the class…</p>
<p>Then there was the other example where someone would ask a question prefaced with "I had a conversation with Gemini/ChatGPT and it said" and the shared chat logs would show it leading them to the wrong conclusions (hence why they're asking the question originally.) This could be biased as only the confusing/misleading chats would be the ones being shared; any successful application of an llm would not end up as a question posted to the public forums, though sometimes people would try to answer questions with llm output: "I put your question into Gemini and it said…" Gee, thanks!</p>
<h3 id=goals>goals</h3>
<p>So, one of the reasons I did a master's is because I wanted to leverage the degree to get a new job doing computer science and not just software engineering. Or at least not simple software engineering, simple being what I consider simple.</p>
<p>That has not happened yet.</p>
<p>I applied to several places that I thought were great, and that were specifically entry-level level which mentioned things like high performance computing and scientific visualization (classes I've taken), but mainly heard nothing back or told that I was not a good fit (is that sentence structure correct?)</p>
<p>Really, cold applying has always been a weakness for some unknown reason as my response rate for doing that is abysmal, and I don't really want to get referred in or skip lines because of my meritocracy beliefs.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I learned that meritocracy originally had negative connotations and read the reasons why, pretty interesting material.</p>
<h3 id=conclusion>conclusion</h3>
<p>Do I think it was worth it? I mean… taking classes while working is a unique experience (that I may not want to experience again). I enjoyed the learning, but what I admittedly did not like was the pressure of grading, even though it's not likely that I would've received poor enough grades to fail out. Of course, grades are, in a sense, a motivator for keeping up with studies and are probably part of what kept driving me in the last 2 semesters.</p>
<p>And I'm getting a piece of paper and a line to add to my resume so that's also a plus.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+after a mistake.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### llm usage</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The number of times I saw someone saying they asked ai or had a conversation</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with an llm about a class topic was... pretty high. And the actual usage was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+pretty worrying.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+For example, in the security class I took where no one knew what was going to be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+on the final or how it was going to be structured, someone went ahead and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+generated a multiple-choice exam with some kind of llm and shared in with the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+class. On top of the exam including content that was never covered in the course</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+(fair, considering that&#x27;s how the midterm was), a large portion of the questions</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+had choices of which all were wrong or multiple options could be correct (in my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+opinion). Furthermore there was no answer key to check against so I&#x27;m not sure</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+how useful the mock exam actually was (spoiler: it was not useful at all). That</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+post actually received the most number of upvotes I&#x27;ve ever seen in the class...</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Then there was the other example where someone would ask a question prefaced</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with &quot;I had a conversation with Gemini/ChatGPT and it said&quot; and the shared chat</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+logs would show it leading them to the wrong conclusions (hence why they&#x27;re</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+asking the question originally.) This could be biased as only the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+confusing/misleading chats would be the ones being shared; any successful</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+application of an llm would not end up as a question posted to the public</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+forums, though sometimes people would try to answer questions with llm output:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&quot;I put your question into Gemini and it said...&quot; Gee, thanks!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### goals</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+So, one of the reasons I did a master&#x27;s is because I wanted to leverage the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+degree to get a new job doing computer science and not just software</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+engineering. Or at least not simple software engineering, simple being what I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+consider simple.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+That has not happened yet.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I applied to several places that I thought were great, and that were</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+specifically entry-level level which mentioned things like high performance</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+computing and scientific visualization (classes I&#x27;ve taken), but mainly heard</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+nothing back or told that I was not a good fit (is that sentence structure</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+correct?)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Really, cold applying has always been a weakness for some unknown reason as my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+response rate for doing that is abysmal, and I don&#x27;t really want to get referred</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in or skip lines because of my meritocracy beliefs.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+On an unrelated note, I learned that meritocracy originally had negative</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+connotations and read the reasons why, pretty interesting material.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### conclusion</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Do I think it was worth it? I mean... taking classes while working is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a unique experience (that I may not want to experience again). I enjoyed the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+learning, but what I admittedly did not like was the pressure of grading, even</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+though it&#x27;s not likely that I would&#x27;ve received poor enough grades to fail out.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Of course, grades are, in a sense, a motivator for keeping up with studies and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+are probably part of what kept driving me in the last 2 semesters.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And I&#x27;m getting a piece of paper and a line to add to my resume so that&#x27;s also a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+plus.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Is that what people with master&#x27;s degrees call themselves? People with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+doctorates get called doctor and have a dr. prefix, so surely people with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+masters&#x27; can call themselves masters and have a... mr... prefix... That&#x27;s what</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+mr. stands for, right? Master?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+All jokes aside, I feel quite accomplished; I set my mind (and money) to a one</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+year commitment and was able to follow through. Technically I haven&#x27;t graduated</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+yet since there are 3 weeks left, but I have high enough scores in my current</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+class to pass without doing anything else.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The real question is if I&#x27;ll keep grinding for A&#x27;s this semester, lean back and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+relax, or make some half-assed effort to finish the remaining assignments. Who</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+knows?</span>
