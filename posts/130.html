Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=i-am-a-master>i am a master</h1>
<p>Is that what people with master's degrees call themselves? People with doctorates get called doctor and have a dr. prefix, so surely people with masters' can call themselves masters and have a… mr… prefix… That's what mr. stands for, right? Master?</p>
<p>All jokes aside, I feel quite accomplished; I set my mind (and money) to a one year commitment and was able to follow through. Technically I haven't graduated yet since there are 3 weeks left, but I have high enough scores in my current class to pass without doing anything else.</p>
<p>The real question is if I'll keep grinding for A's this semester, lean back and relax, or make some half-assed effort to finish the remaining assignments. Who knows?</p>
