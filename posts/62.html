<h1 id=personal-yearly-reflection-3>personal yearly reflection 3</h1>
<p>Well, there's a chance I won't be able to post this exactly on Decemeber first because I don't feel the normal drive to write it but we'll see. I'll also have to look at how I structured last year's content because I'd like to keep things consistent - well, I believe I always start off with responding to last year's topics anyways.</p>
<h2 id=recap>recap</h2>
<h3 id=remote-work>remote work</h3>
<p>Yep, still remote working. I am kind of a bit lax with start and end times but otherwise I will always work when there is work… which actually isn't too often - work comes in bursts but there are some periods of weird downtime due to not having <em>enough</em> work prepared to be picked up because it needs PM input or UX designs (trust me, these are probably not important). This was actually a reason that I left my previous job…</p>
<p>Although I'd say with my current living situation I'm not the biggest fan of my working space due to some personal reasons.</p>
<h3 id=seniority>seniority</h3>
<p>Well, I'm constantly told the code I write is at a senior level, and I'm pretty experienced and sometimes the go to person with some of the systems at the current job so from a technical perspective I guess I'm getting pretty senior.</p>
<p>Communication-wise I'd say I'm also getting up there.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll get the senior title soon(tm) but hopefully that's not just title inflation or something of the sort.</p>
<h3 id=free-time>free time</h3>
<p>I have free time. I just don't have motiviation to really leverage for anything productive for some reason. I stopped practicing languages because Duolingo turned into a chore unfortunately, and I also stopped listening to the SE podcast because at the end it was just noise (I'm not diving into any of those topics after all).</p>
<p>What I do after work hours is basically just pick a tv show or movie to binge; basically I watch all the aired episodes over the course of a week and rinse and repeat.</p>
<h3 id=blog-stats>blog stats</h3>
<p>I guess I've written less this year, based on the number of posts between this reflection and the previous versus that one and that one's previous. I also know for a fact that I've written some very very short posts that, let's be honest, shouldn't even be posts. I feel like I don't necessarily have the drive or even content to write as often as I'd like, although I do happen to be sitting on a very nice topic at the moment.</p>
<p>I had also tried to improve the quality of writing by writing things but not committing them until at least a day after and only after re-reading and had also tried to fix spelling issues by running aspell now and then, but realized I actually <em>don't</em> care as I prefer the stream of thought style writing with all it's imperfections. I have made some improvements to tooling around linting markdown though, so that satisfies some ocd for me.</p>
<h3 id=pandemic>pandemic</h3>
<p>Yep getting those super lonely vibes. But I did start hanging out with some old friends in addition to finding some new ones that played games on the regular so that's been quite good for my mental health.</p>
<p>I'm honestly not sure if we're still in a "pandemic" because my life hasn't really changed, but I guess it's safe to say that we're at least not on lockdown anymore. Perhaps covid is just a fact of life nowadays.</p>
<h3 id=new-professional-project>new professional project</h3>
<p>I have considered looking… mainly because there is just too much downtime at my current job as I mentioned before. I'm not a big fan of being idle… but I'd also hate to potentially cripple a company or be labeled a job hopper. It's not a money thing I swear!</p>
<p>There is also the fact that I've kind of settled into more product focused tasks, which I find fine although I used to, and still, want to be more of a technical type. Being a product focused engineer is fine because I am kind of exposed to user needs which is one of the reasons I originally wrote software - making somthing people enjoy - but there's always the barrier known as the product manager that keeps users away from engineers.</p>
<p>Maybe I can take a small downlevel to work on something more technical and interesting.</p>
<h3 id=last-years-goal-summary>last year's goal summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fix acne - yep, discussion topic</li>
<li>Solo trip somewhere - yep</li>
<li>Working on social issues/volunteering - no</li>
<li>Set up some solid relationships - maybe, discussion topic</li>
<li>Drink water - yep</li>
<li>Improve networking - no</li>
<li>Improve verbal communication - yep</li>
<li>Exercise - no</li>
<li>Sleep on time - maybe</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=acne-and-appearance>acne and appearance</h3>
<p>The funny thing about my current situation is no one really sees me on a regular basis, so I guess I let my appearance go a bit. I'm not going to give too many details about my physical traits because muh privacay and whatnot, but I've always had a normal BMI, almost smack dab in the middle of what the NIH considers normal and I'm of average height. What did go is mainly my facial hair which I only deal with once it gets annoying - I happen to be of a race that doesn't have to deal with it too often so go figure.</p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to acne, I had a weird case but got it fully taken care of mainly halfway through the year, had it come back a few months later, then took care of it again. I literally considered writing a skin care post about this but thought otherwise and decided to just dump some thoughts here once the time comes. For me what worked was benzoyl peroxide, adapalene, and sleeping early. The important part is to do this stuff consistently, as I have reason to believe the relapse was due to me staying up late night to play a new game.</p>
<h3 id=moving>moving</h3>
<p>It's on my mind, my current living situation is pretty terrible (but I have virtually no COL) and I want out. Part of the issue is no privacy, and another issue is that as an extremely light sleeper it is virtually impossible for me to sleep until like 2AM unless the stars align.</p>
<p>I have been looking at various areas to move to, but I want to be careful as if I move, I will buy a house rather than rent, and if I buy a house, I will pay for it in full rather than via mortgage since I have the savings and can afford to do so.</p>
<h3 id=relationships-and-activities>relationships and activities</h3>
<p>So I joined a small group of people who play a player versus player game mode of a game casually and for fun on a regular basis. I hadn't played it before but I think I got pretty good over the months we've been playing together - in fact I may be one of our best players now but I digress. Small scale player versus player is arguably one of those most interesting aspects of gaming because it has the most potential of providing new experiences - any player versus environment content ends up being quickly repetitive and ends up being mainly a grindfest. In this case, for me, it's typically going around a battlefield as a group of 15-20 (organized in subgroups of 5) and brawling other groups of the same size or larger.</p>
<p>However, around three quarters into the year, some guy who disappeared long ago from the group reappeared and tried whipping us into tryhard competitive mode. I wasn't too exceited about this because, while I don't mind going competetive, I realized this guy had the kind of personality I did not like to play with - extremely demeaning, blame shifting, and heavily unconstructive criticism. Admittedely, it was quite fun as we ended up recruiting some previously-competetive-but-now-casual-competetive players who gave some good insight into gameplay; we often record our own point of views in fights and go over them to review fights and look for improvements. That was good fun seeing everyone improving and learning a lot myself.</p>
<p>We ended up trying out for a tournament but got shafted by the brackets; there was a professional-competetive bracket and a casual-competetive bracket and we ended up having to face a couple of professional-competetive teams because there was no space for them in their own bracket. We place towards the bottom of the rankings and it seemed like some people took it very hard and blamed it on a bad day rather than just not being at a high enough level. Who knows? Oh yeah, did I mention I didn't play because this was for EU regions so I was busy at the time the tournament took place. I think we lost a couple of chill people because of this and now we're on a break for the rest of the year. Unfortunate!</p>
<h3 id=new-goals>new goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Look into places to move to<ul>
<li>Yeah my current living situation is retarded but I do save mad amounts of money. Six figure savings per year. Is moving somewhere better worth that much to me? It's possible!</li></ul></li>
<li>Look for a more fulfilling job<ul>
<li>I need consistent work. I could contract or something too.</li></ul></li>
<li>Relationships<ul>
<li>I'm not going to lie, romance is on my mind since it is free to wander so often. Since I plan to move and/or change jobs, perhaps then will be the time to pursue something? Dang I hope I don't sound super desperate.</li></ul></li>
<li>Solo trip somewhere (2021)</li>
<li>Drink water (2020)</li>
<li>Sleep on time (habitual)</li>
</ol>
<p>Honestly moving will probably trigger a lot of changes for me (for the better), although it's possible I may just move go back to my old lazy self. We'll see what happens when the economy is doing better.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+I realized this guy had the kind of personality I did not like to play with -</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+extremely demeaning, blame shifting, and heavily unconstructive criticism.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Admittedely, it was quite fun as we ended up recruiting some</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+previously-competetive-but-now-casual-competetive players who gave some good</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+insight into gameplay; we would often record our own point of views in fights</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and go over them. That was good fun seeing everyone improving and learning a lot</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+myself.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+We ended up trying out for a tournament but got shafted by the brackets; there</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was a professional-competetive bracket and a casual-competetive bracket and we</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ended up having to face a couple of professional-competetive teams because there</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was no space for them in their own bracket. We place towards the bottom of the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+rankings and it seemed like some people took it very hard and blamed it on a bad</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+day rather than just not being at a high enough level. Who knows? Oh yeah, did I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+mention I didn&#x27;t play because this was for EU regions so I was busy at the time</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the tournament took place. I think we lost a couple of chill people because of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this and now we&#x27;re on a break for the rest of the year. Unfortunate!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### new goals</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Look into places to move to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - Yeah my current living situation is retarded but I do save mad amounts of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      money. Six figure savings per year. Is moving somewhere better worth that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      much to me? It&#x27;s possible!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Look for a more fulfilling job</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - I need consistent work. I could contract or something too.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Relationships</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - I&#x27;m not going to lie, romance is on my mind since it is free to wander so</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      often. Since I plan to move and/or change jobs, perhaps then will be the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      time to pursue something? Dang I hope I don&#x27;t sound super desperate.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+4. Solo trip somewhere (2021)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+5. Drink water (2020)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+6. Sleep on time (habitual)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Honestly moving will probably trigger a lot of changes for me (for the better),</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+although it&#x27;s possible I may just move go back to my old lazy self. We&#x27;ll see</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+what happens when the economy is doing better.</span>
