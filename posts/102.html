Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX and TikZ diagrams, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=dropping-a-table-with-constraints>dropping a table with constraints</h1>
<p>If you can't drop an unused table with constraints due to deadlock issues, try dropping the constraints individually first.</p>
<p>Recently someone was cleaning up a large table by detaching and dropping an unused partition in postgres. It lead to a deadlock message.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-102-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-102-1></label><code>prod=&gt; drop table r1_partition;
ERROR: deadlock detected
DETAIL: Process p1 waits <span class=hljs-keyword>for</span> AccessExclusiveLock on relation r2 of database d1;
blocked by process p2. Process p2 waits <span class=hljs-keyword>for</span> AccessShareLock on relation r3 of
database d1; blocked by process p1.

Time: 20000 ms
</code></pre>
<p>We can easily see the deadlock where p1 has a lock on what p2 wants, and p2 has a lock on what p1 wants. Checking the server log lead to seeing a query like the following:</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-102-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-102-2></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>select</span> <span class=hljs-operator>*</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>from</span> r2 <span class=hljs-keyword>join</span> r3 <span class=hljs-keyword>join</span> r4
</code></pre>
<p>The important thing to note is that this query is not related, at all to r1_partition. However it is joining tables that r1_partition has references to.</p>
<p>While I haven't verified this explanation, I believe the reason is this:</p>
<p>Postgres implements foreign key references by using triggers. Deleting a trigger requires Access Exclusive locks on the table, so dropping a table requires Access Exclusive locks on all referenced tables.</p>
<p>The select requires Access Shared locks on some of those tables which conflicted with the Access Exclusive locks.</p>
<p>It was able to get a lock on r2 while the drop process was able to acquire its lock for r3, which caused the deadlock when trying to drop the partition.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-102-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-102-3></label><code>Foreign-key constraints:
    <span class=hljs-string>&quot;fk1&quot;</span> FOREIGN KEY (x) references r2(x)
    <span class=hljs-string>&quot;fk2&quot;</span> FOREIGN KEY (y) references r3(x)
</code></pre>
<p>The way we got around this was to drop the constraint first.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-102-4 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-102-4></label><code>prod=&gt; alter table r1_partition drop constraint fk1;
