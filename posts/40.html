<h1 id=an-amazon-recruiter-conversation>an amazon recruiter conversation</h1>
<p><em>Email names/wording are modified for privacy</em> Recently I received an email from an Amazon recruiter out of the blue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is R, and I am an Engineering Recruiter for Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS). After reading through your profile, I wanted to reach out to you today. Today I am reaching out because I’m looking for Software Development Engineer (SDE)’s for various locations.</p>
<p>We have pre-scheduled interview slots that are coming up, and as I read through your profile, I wanted to make sure you were considered for one of our opportunities. If you are interested in learning more about some of these opportunities, I’d like to move you to our next step of the process. Please let me know if you are interested.</p>
<p>I appreciate your time, and I do hope to hear back from you. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that caught my attention is that I have an actual profile out there and that this was sent to a specific email that I used several years ago. The significance of the email is that I use many emails set up in a tree like structure, such that all emails are forwarded to the root email, I create new emails that forward to the root and periodically nest the tree under a new root email. This means I have a general idea of where someone got an email based on the receiver - in this case the email was from a few years ago and job search related, interesting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I (kind of) meticulously scrub my data after my search is finished which technically should leave no information online anymore, but as we all know it's still out there somewhere and I was curious to know where so I could delete it.</p>
<p>Another thing I noted is that this message used two spaces after every period, which suggested that it was manually typed up by an older person and not a template. I also took the liberty of looking up the recruiter on LinkedIn and it looks like he's been doing technical recruiting for a couple decades but moved to at Amazon recently.</p>
<p>Also, the email was sent at around 12am west coast time. I figure he's trying to meet some kind of deadline for filling up the candidate pipeline and I might as well see if I can help somehow even if I'm not really interested.</p>
<p>Because of these things, and the fact that I'm pretty starved socially (maybe enough to try to start a casual conversation with a <em>recruiter</em>, see previous posts), I decided to respond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm not actively looking for a new position at the moment but might be interested in a change under the right circumstances. Any information about the opportunities would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>My only specific question at the moment is what profile did you read?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the response. I saw both profile in a job site, and also looking at an old resume of yours. Based on that, made me want to try and reach out. Wasn’t sure what you’ve been doing since, or if it be a fit…but never hurts to try.</p>
<p>I work with a few different teams, mostly an innovation SDE team within Amazon’s AWS. Below I’m including an example of a job description.</p>
<p>Job Description:
<a href=https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1237225/software-development-engineer>url</a></p>
<p>If you have gone the SDE path, and you feel there is a fit and interest, let me know. I’d be happy to start the process. Or talk more about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, unfortunately no specific info on where the profile is, but what I did learn is that Amazon somehow has one of my old resumes on file. I don't remember applying for any jobs at Amazon before so I went to look at any past emails. Turns out I had another Amazon recruiter contact me a few years back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to consider you for a full-time Software Development Engineering role with our People Technology team at Amazon! We are looking for an enthusiastic technologist with experience building global software solutions at massive scale. As a key member of our Analytics and ML technology team, you’ll work closely along with our Principle SDE and Sr. Engineers in designing a strategy to detect and correct errors in existing and new Time and Attendance systems. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to have a global impact on a Greenfield project involving cutting-edge AWS technologies, data analytics, and machine learning. If you’re an Engineer who can take a complicated problem, Think Big, Invent and Simplify, and deliver it to Production with full autonomy, then this is the place for you!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in being considered, please send along your resume. I will personally review your resume along with the hiring team and follow up with next steps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decided to look at this person's LinkedIn now, and it looks like they've since moved from Amazon and are now a sr technical recruiter at Facebook. The interesting thing here is that he was asking for a resume, and I never responded - so I don't think this is how Amazon picked up one of my old resumes. So then where did they get it? Privacy leak nightmare, I suppose - most job search websites seem to be extremely shady and spam you with "job" opportunities; I wouldn't be surprised if they sold my resume.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the recent recruiter, here's a the job description in case it ever changed or the url dies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>We believe the revolution enabled by internet-connected “smart” devices is just beginning, and we see a bright future for those that transform their business to leverage them.

</blockquote>
<p>"Join our team as we build brand-new solutions for smart energy, unlocking the potential of machine learning and IoT to meet the demands of tomorrow’s net carbon zero market." Hmm, yes, pitching a job related to the environment is a good way to hook zoomers i.e. me, I guess. Unfortunately I failed to see the connection between AWS and this and mentioned so in my response. I assumed it was like professional/managed services for energy sector customers. I don't really know much of AWS outside of the fact that it provides computing resources/platforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haha, a resume from YYYY or before sounds about right and yes, I've been doing software engineering work since then.</p>
<p>Working on improving energy efficiency sounds interesting and meaningful to me but I don't necessarily see the connection to AWS. Could you elaborate on the job description?</p>
<p>I see this is a Seattle based position, are there any other options? Full disclosure, my current job is fully remote (although coincidentally also has an office in Seattle) with flexible hours, and I am a little averse towards relocating at the moment. Other than that, I just have a general set of questions that I usually like to learn about any new opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locations/remote work policy</li>
<li>Work life balance</li>
<li>Engineering culture</li>
<li>How much time is spent between meeting/working for engineers/what periodic meetings are there</li>
<li>How is work planned and distributed to the team?</li>
<li>Overall process from writing code to landing it in production (tests, code review, etc)</li>
<li>Team/management structure</li>
<li>Some real examples of bugs/features that are being worked</li>
<li>Any on-call responsibilities</li>
<li>Mentorship and knowledge transfer</li>
<li>Visibility of non-engineering departments</li>
<li>Compensation</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's easier to get these answered by starting the process, then sign me up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before sending this response, I already erred towards not going for the opportunity as it seemed like too much of a hassle for a small bump in compensation for a lot lower quality of life and the actual work was still unclear. For these reasons, I decided to lay out my hand with the full disclosure sentence.</p>
<p>Well, I think I showed too much and the recruiter never responded. Which kind of sucks because I wanted to talk to someone at AWS and ask why it's so hard to figure out a list of services you're running before you get billed, especially when one of the core values is Customer Obsessed. Let's be honest, it's because they make more money this way. In fact, based on my experience, maybe people are happier when they ask for and get the refund compared to never having to ask for it in the first place - creating fake friction which they can easily solve. And then there would be people who are (over)billed and say nothing.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: he did eventually respond and I may update this</p>
<h2 id=full-experience>full experience</h2>
<p>Well, since it's the Friday of the week that I was supposed to have the final interview and I had sent an email over a week ago with no follow up, let's take a slightly more detailed look at what happened and some random thoughts I had along the way.</p>
<p>October 5, I receive the first email from the recruiter, which is quoted above. October 5, I respond (because I keep a tight watch over my emails). October 5, He responds about where he found my resume and such. October 5, I respond.</p>
<p>These 4 emails and my thoughts are the ones outlined above, after which I received no response until October 14th, where the recruiter says he did not see his email and avoids answering my questions by saying the answers are team specific, which I find reasonable, and asks again if I'm interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was about to check in and see if you had responded, and just noticing that you had responded, I just hadn’t answered your email. I do apologize, not sure how I missed your email.</p>
<p>I think the teams I work with are working on very exciting and innovative things, like the energy efficiency team. The role is not necessary in Seattle, we have locations in San Francisco and Austin. Maybe some remote/virtual, but those would depend on the actual teams. But we do have them.</p>
<p>In regards to the question, they vary depend on the teams and projects that they are assigned. These are questions that we can make sure you get answers to during an interview.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested. The next part of the process is a technical assessment, I know this is common in other teach companies. However, I would spend some time with you beforehand to help you prepare for it. I see my role being your advocate, so would want to make sure you do well in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I respond on October 15th, saying it's not a problem because recruiters work with many candidates a lot of the time and some are bound to fall through the cracks. Also I candidly (?) make a joke that he had ghosted me. I also try to start a discussion on remote policies as Amazon had recently revised their wfh plan between our last correspondence. I decide to go ahead with the process but let him know that I'm currently on-call and may have to drop any scheduled processes if something at my work blows up.</p>
<p>Ok, then on October 18th I receive a few links - a couple for an online exam, and a ton of interview prep things along with a one week deadline. I'll summarize what was given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation Resources:</li>
<li>HackerRank Test tips: https://www.hackerrank.com/tests/info/interface</li>
<li>HackerRank Demo Test: https://www.hackerrank.com/test/some/link</li>
<li>Project Euler - http://projecteuler.net/. If you’ve been out of practice, do up to problem 60 or so. You should be forced to build useful libraries, which will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat or take shortcuts.</li>
<li>Google Coding Contest has additional practice questions: https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2020</li>
<li>Understand high scale architecture. Go look at how other big sites are structured: http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example</li>
<li>Fundamentals: Go back and re-educate yourself on all data structures and data structure algorithms. They come up all the time. Understand all time and space complexity. Make sure you even get into more exotic things like hashmaps, b+trees (and variants), caches (and associated algorithms). You may want to visit www.codechef.com or MYCODESCHOOL : https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool</li>
</ul>
<p>My god, all these resources and I've just started? Well little does he know I used to do competitive programming and programming puzzles as a hobby a long time ago. Combined with the fact that I also tutored ds &amp; algo for several semesters in uni, I have a pretty solid grasp over these things without any preparation despite not having done any of these activities seriously for the past couple years. My weakest point is probably the architectural things but that's mainly because I'm not sure if my ideas are "good". I do have various ideas from a basic understanding of how things work and from stuff I've read. As for the assessments themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technical section itself is 120 minutes to complete 2 coding challenges and coding approach. The time remaining will be clearly displayed in the left hand corner of the screen throughout the test.</li>
<li>Cultural section has two parts to it, slider questions and multiple choice questions. As mention above, because the Amazon Leadership Principles are very important to what we do, keep those in mind as you answer these questions.</li>
<li>Slider questions must be completed. There are 50 questions, and can not be left blank.</li>
<li>FYI: There are 40 questions that are multiple choice. If you don’t have time with the multiple choice section, you can leave these blank.</li>
<li>The purpose of this section is to understand the cultural compatibility with Amazon and AWS.</li>
<li>This section is not timed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so a timed coding section and some cultural thing? I ended up doing no prep because of time constraints but was able to find an open slot on October 21 to finish at least the coding section. The questions were pretty simple, I spent 5 minutes on the first question and 30 minutes on the second - I think I got an ideal solution for the second, but for the first one I would've needed to be able to keep referenced to individual nodes in a linked list which I think means I had to write my own implementation, which I opted not to and just gave a suboptimal solution by scanning an array with build in methods.</p>
<p>The interesting part is the "cultural" section. I think it was less cultural and a combination of technical and competency. The technical part was about choosing various technologies to do things like k/v vs relational database vs something like elasticsearch for storing images, or what are some good things to help detect/fix issues in your application (monitoring, scripts to fix stuff, etc). The problem was a lot of the answers were really "it depends", but since that wasn't a choice, I just went with whatever I figured was best. The other part was more or less a work simulation where you answer how you react in certain scenarios, ok no too bad.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I took a little under an hour total for both parts. Speed is my specialty.</p>
<p>Then I get an email at 12:01 AM (my time) on October 22 congratulating me on passing and to set up a phone interview. I literally thought it was ops genie paging me at first because it was that late and I assumed any notification was an alert. Is it an automated system of some kind? Well, I respond in the morning and realize I'm setting up a call to discuss what's going to be on the phone interview… What's wrong with just the email packet? Well, some scheduling problems happen because the recruiter had a doctors appointment but we eventually get on a call. It's just a simple discussion but I note that he is coughing a lot (Covid?). He then sends me a ton more resources and what might be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The phone screen will be one hour in duration. They will ask behavioral questions surrounding the leadership principles.</li>
<li>Some general coding interview tips like resolving any ambiguities about the question</li>
<li>A worksheet where you can come up with examples of <em>each</em> of Amazon's 14 leadership principles (!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The recruiter kept emphasizing that I should have 2 stories for each of the leadership principles beforehand to pull on. Holy crap, 28 stories? For a phone interview? Well, I put like 5 minutes work in before I knew it was moot, because in general the only stories I have are the very big fancy ones so I only came up with like 3 or 4, most of which are readable via the other posts. I decided to say screw it and wing it like every other interview I do. Although I did make the decision to call up the recruiter for a casual chat using the fact that I couldn't come up with stories as an excuse. And now I was sent a link to a calendar type app to schedule the interview and set it up for November 3rd.</p>
<p>A day or so before the interview, I looked over the link and realize it has a link to a job description attached to it. And that job was entirely different from the one originally shown, and had a very generic description.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AWS Worldwide Revenue Operations (WWRO) team is a centralized AWS sales operation function. WWRO is responsible for operational activities spanning from management of compensation policies to building enterprise-scale tooling for customer management and business insight. The mission of WWRO is to make the AWS seller organization the most efficient in the world, where sellers focus the majority of their time on customers. We do this by investing in integrated experiences for sellers, high bar security practices, deep telemetry and metrics, and the tools and resources that sellers need to efficiently do their jobs. We consider it our job to understand, coordinate, and help improve the operations work being done across the AWS seller organization.</p>
<p>We are a growing organization tasked with solving complex business problems by building scalable engineering solutions to give AWS sellers the biggest competitive advantage. We encourage and support our engineers to think big and innovate on behalf of our customers.</p>
<p>Learn and Be Curious. We have a formal mentor search application that lets you find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career progression of our team members.</p>
<p>Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.</p>
<p>Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh boy, what have I gotten myself into? Well, I figured I could learn more about the job and get my original questions answered in this interview. I go to the interview on Chime but in the beginning have trouble getting my external camera to work. I spent probably 15 minutes trying to figure this out, and ended up eating into the interview time despite joining early. It turns out that my privacy controls somehow make Chime not happy, so I had to disable a lot of them… and also use my laptop's built-in camera. The interviewing engineer was patiently (I assume) waiting. Oh well, I get the question and type up an answer. The question is one of the one in <a href=/puzzles>puzzles</a>. I think I finished in less than 10 minutes. She mentions no one has finished so quickly and I've probably passed as long as the recruiter likes the feedback she would pass along (why would the recruiter have a say on the technical aspect?) Turns out there is nothing else to the interview so I'm free to ask questions with the 45 minutes left. I quickly learn that the engineer interviewing me is on-call, isn't even on the team that I'm being pushed towards, and can't answer any of my questions. I do a quick search on her and find out she's been at Amazon for 5 years, spending 3 years on one team and 2 on her current one. That's a pretty long tenure for Amazon. I end up chatting with her about Amazon's remote policies, high turnover rate, and some general things like being on-call. I decide to end the meeting after 15 or so more minutes and comment that it's always great when meetings go under their planned duration and wish her a good lunch.</p>
<p>November 8 rolls around and I get a response from the recruiter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope you had a great weekend. I’ve received feedback from the Phone Interview and it looks great. Wanted to check in with you to discuss next steps and scheduling an on-site (virtual) interview. Let me know if you have time to talk today or tomorrow. Let me know what your availability looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I give him some pretty large time periods for when I'm available because full remote benefits, but also express my concern about not knowing what the job actually entails due to the super generic description.</p>
<p>He responds on November 10th, and gives me some solid project examples for various teams, but not the one that the job description was for. We end up on an interesting call which actually ends up being the final bit of communication. I opened up the call by saying I still do not know what the job entails, and then I have to tell him that it was about the WWRO organization. Then he sets some tentative dates for the final interview (December 1st) and goes over the format which is like 6-8 interviewers for a total of 4-5 hours. He also mentions some weekly call where I can ask questions that I might have about the final interview process. Talk about complex. At this point I'm pretty invested (as in I've made it this far with no prep, might as well yolo the last interview too) and say ok, let's do it. And that's really the last time I heard from him. I sent a follow up email on November 17th but have received nothing.</p>
<p>Overall? I think it was a neutral or neutral/bad experience, mainly because of the ghosting in the end. If I did put as much preparation as the recruiter was pushing me to put in, then it would definitely be very bad. I estimate my time spent to be around 4 hours - 1.5 hours for the interviews, 1 hour for my call to the recruiter for a casual chat, 1 hour for the recruiter calling me to set things up, and 30 minutes for emailing and other stuff. That's like \$300-\$400 that Amazon owes me!</p>
<p>A funny but dark joke I thought of one day was that maybe I was literally ghosted - couple the fact that on all of our calls the recruiter coughed a lot, had a doctor's visit a few weeks back, and we're in a pandemic… yes maybe that was the case. No offense of course, I'm just making a hypothesis based on some random observations I made.</p>
<h2 id=some-followups>some followups</h2>
<p>During July 2022, I receive another standard recruitment email where I decline and also note that I'm still waiting on a final interview as a slight.</p>
<p>I also note a <a href=https://www.amazon.jobs/en/privacy/eu>privacy policy</a> link in this email signature and try to get myself removed from whatever candidate bank Amazon has. I guess they knew I couldn't leverage GDPR and I got the response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, our team is not able to support your request. Please note that at the moment there is no data protection legislation in USA that would give you the right to request deletion of your personal data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm… that's unfortunate; I thought about countering with
<a href=https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa>CCPA</a> but guessed it was more work than it was worth… (I don't want to start a legal kerfuffle as I'd start out on the losing side obviously.)</p>
<p>Later on September 2022, a recruiter reaches out and says I can skip all assessments to the final interview with the following text</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope all is well and I know we lost contact so I just wanted to reach out to you, to see if you’re still interested in considering a new L5 Software Development Engineer position at Amazon.</p>
<p>You have an outstanding profile and experience that would make you a great fit here at Amazon, and since so I would love to talk and waive any assesments to fast track you to a Final Virtual On-Site interview to make this process as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>I know last time we talked I offered you the chance to bypass the online assessments and Technical Phone Screens to push you straight to the final round, and I am willing to do so for the rest of the month.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are still interested in being fast tracked to the Final Round, as we would love to have you interview.</p>
<p>I have the following dates available for the Final Round:</p>
<p>(days in the month)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue is we never talked so something weird is happening here. This email is from a different recruiter than the one I went through the original process with; in fact this person has only been at Amazon for a few months based on his online profiles and was previously a senior recruiter at another big tech company for several years. It is possible that this is some kind of fake urgency based recruiting, not unlike how Amazon marks items as on a steep discount when they aren't in an attempt to entice consumers. Or a new recruiter picking up where the other one left off. Either way I wasn't interested so I just declined.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I also note a [privacy policy](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/privacy/eu) link in this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+email signature and try to get myself removed from whatever candidate bank Amazon</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+has. I guess they knew I couldn&#x27;t leverage GDPR and I got the response:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Unfortunately, our team is not able to support your request. Please note that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; at the moment there is no data protection legislation in USA that would give you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the right to request  deletion of your personal data.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Hmm... that&#x27;s unfortunate; I thought about countering with [CCPA](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+but guessed it was more work than it was worth... (I don&#x27;t want to start a legal</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+kerfuffle as I&#x27;d start out on the losing side obviously.)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Later on September 2022, a recruiter reaches out and says I can skip all assessments</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to the final interview with the following text</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Hope all is well and I know we lost contact so I just wanted to reach out to you,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; to see if you’re still interested in considering a new L5 Software Development</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Engineer position at Amazon.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; You have an outstanding profile and experience that would make you a great fit</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; here at Amazon, and since so I would love to talk and waive any assesments to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; fast track you to a Final Virtual On-Site interview to make this process as seamless</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; as possible.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I know last time we talked I offered you the chance to bypass the online assessments</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and Technical Phone Screens to push you straight to the final round, and I am</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; willing to do so for the rest of the month.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Let me know if you are still interested in being fast tracked to the Final Round,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; as we would love to have you interview.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I have the following dates available for the Final Round:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; (days in the month)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The issue is we never talked so something weird is happening here. This email is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+from a different recruiter than the one I went through the original process with;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in fact this person has only been at Amazon for a few months based on his online</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+profiles and was previously a senior recruiter at another big tech company for several</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+years. It is possible that this is some kind of fake urgency based recruiting, not</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+unlike how Amazon marks items as on a steep discount when they aren&#x27;t in an attempt</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to entice consumers. Or a new recruiter picking up where the other one left off.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Either way I wasn&#x27;t interested so I just declined.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+## full experience</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, since it&#x27;s the Friday of the week that I was supposed to have the final interview</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and I had sent an email over a week ago with no follow up, let&#x27;s take a slightly</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+more detailed look at what happened and some random thoughts I had along the way.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+October 5, I receive the first email from the recruiter, which is quoted above.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+October 5, I respond (because I keep a tight watch over my emails). October 5, He</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+responds about where he found my resume and such. October 5, I respond.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+These 4 emails and my thoughts are the ones outlined above, after which I received</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+no response until October 14th, where the recruiter says he did not see his email</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and avoids answering my questions by saying the answers are team specific, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I find reasonable, and asks again if I&#x27;m interested.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I was about to check in and see if you had responded, and just noticing that you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; had responded, I just hadn’t answered your email.  I do apologize, not sure how</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I missed your email.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I think the teams I work with are working on very exciting and innovative things,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; like the energy efficiency team.  The role is not necessary in Seattle, we have</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; locations in San Francisco and Austin.  Maybe some remote/virtual, but those would</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; depend on the actual teams.  But we do have them.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; In regards to the question, they vary depend on the teams and projects that they</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; are assigned.  These are questions that we can make sure you get answers to during</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; an interview.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Let me know if you are interested.  The next part of the process is a technical</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; assessment, I know this is common in other teach companies.  However, I would</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; spend some time with you beforehand to help you prepare for it.  I see my role</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; being your advocate, so would want to make sure you do well in it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I respond on October 15th, saying it&#x27;s not a problem because recruiters work with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+many candidates a lot of the time and some are bound to fall through the cracks.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Also I candidly (?) make a joke that he had ghosted me. I also try to start a discussion</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+on remote policies as Amazon had recently revised their wfh plan between our last</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+correspondence. I decide to go ahead with the process but let him know that I&#x27;m</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+currently on-call and may have to drop any scheduled processes if something at my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+work blows up.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Ok, then on October 18th I receive a few links - a couple for an online exam, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a ton of interview prep things along with a one week deadline. I&#x27;ll summarize what</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was given below:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- Preparation Resources:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - HackerRank Test tips: https://www.hackerrank.com/tests/info/interface</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - HackerRank Demo Test: https://www.hackerrank.com/test/some/link</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - Project Euler - http://projecteuler.net/. If you’ve been out of practice, do</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    up to problem 60 or so. You should be forced to build useful libraries, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    or take shortcuts.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - Google Coding Contest has additional practice questions: https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2020</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - Understand high scale architecture. Go look at how other big sites are structured:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - Fundamentals: Go back and re-educate yourself on all data structures and data</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    structure algorithms. They come up all the time. Understand all time and space</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    complexity. Make sure you even get into more exotic things like hashmaps, b+trees</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    (and variants), caches (and associated algorithms). You may want to visit</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    www.codechef.com or MYCODESCHOOL : https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+My god, all these resources and I&#x27;ve just started? Well little does he know I used</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to do competitive programming and programming puzzles as a hobby a long time ago.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Combined with the fact that I also tutored ds &amp; algo for several semesters in uni,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I have a pretty solid grasp over these things without any preparation despite not</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+having done any of these activities seriously for the past couple years. My weakest</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+point is probably the architectural things but that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m not sure</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+if my ideas are &quot;good&quot;. I do have various ideas from a basic understanding of how</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+things work and from stuff I&#x27;ve read. As for the assessments themselves:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- The technical section itself is 120 minutes to complete 2 coding challenges and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  coding approach. The time remaining will be clearly displayed in the left hand</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  corner of the screen throughout the test.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- Cultural section has two parts to it, slider questions and multiple choice questions.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  As mention above, because the Amazon Leadership Principles are very important</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  to what we do, keep those in mind as you answer these questions.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - Slider questions must be completed.  There are 50 questions, and can not be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    left blank.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - FYI: There are 40 questions that are multiple choice.  If you don’t have time</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    with the multiple choice section, you can leave these blank.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - The purpose of this section is to understand the cultural compatibility with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    Amazon and AWS.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  - This section is not timed.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Ok, so a timed coding section and some cultural thing? I ended up doing no prep</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+because of time constraints but was able to find an open slot on October 21 to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+finish at least the coding section. The questions were pretty simple, I spent</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+5 minutes on the first question and 30 minutes on the second - I think I got</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+an ideal solution for the second, but for the first one I would&#x27;ve needed to be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+able to keep referenced to individual nodes in a linked list which I think means</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I had to write my own implementation, which I opted not to and just gave a suboptimal</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+solution by scanning an array with build in methods.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The interesting part is the &quot;cultural&quot; section. I think it was less cultural and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a combination of technical and competency. The technical part was about choosing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+various technologies to do things like k/v vs relational database vs something like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+elasticsearch for storing images, or what are some good things to help detect/fix</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+issues in your application (monitoring, scripts to fix stuff, etc). The problem</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was a lot of the answers were realy &quot;it depends&quot;, but since that wasn&#x27;t a choice,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I just went with whatever I figured was best. The other part was more or less a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+work simulation where you answer how you react in certain scenarios, ok no too bad.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Overall, I think I took a little under an hour total for both parts. Speed is my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+specialty.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Then I get an email at 12:01 AM (my time) on October 22 congratulating me on passing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and to set up a phone interview. I literally thought it was ops genie paging me</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at first because it was that late and I assumed any notification was an alert. Is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it an automated system of some kind? Well, I respond in the morning and realize</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;m setting up a call to discuss what&#x27;s going to be on the phone interview... What&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+wrong with just the email packet? Well, some scheduling problems happen because</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the recruiter had a doctors appointment but we eventually get on a call. It&#x27;s just</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a simple discussion but I note that he is coughing a lot (Covid?). He then sends</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+me a ton more resources and what might be covered:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- The phone screen will be one hour in duration. They will ask behavioral questions</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  surrounding the leadership principles.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- Some general coding interview tips like resolving any ambiguities about the question</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- A worksheet where you can come up with examples of *each* of Amazon&#x27;s 14 leadership</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  principles (!)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The recruiter kept emphrasizing that I should have 2 stories for each of the leadership</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+principles beforehand to pull on. Holy crap, 28 stories? For a phone interview?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, I put like 5 minutes work in before I knew it was moot, because in general</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the only stories I have are the very big fancy ones so I only came up with like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3 or 4, most of which are readable via the other posts. I decided to say screw it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and wing it like every other interview I do. Although I did make the decision to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+call up the recruiter for a casual chat using the fact that I couldn&#x27;t come up with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+stories as an excuse. And now I was sent a link to a calendar type app to schedule</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the interview and set it up for November 3rd.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+A day or so before the interview, I looked over the link and realize it has a link</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to a job description attached to it. And that job was entirely different from the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+one originally shown, and had a very generic description.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; The AWS Worldwide Revenue Operations (WWRO) team is a centralized AWS sales operation</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; function. WWRO is responsible for operational activities spanning from management</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; of compensation policies to building enterprise-scale tooling for customer management</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and business insight. The mission of WWRO is to make the AWS seller organization</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the most efficient in the world, where sellers focus the majority of their time</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; on customers. We do this by investing in integrated experiences for sellers, high</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; bar security practices, deep telemetry and metrics, and the tools and resources</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; that sellers need to efficiently do their jobs. We consider it our job to understand,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; coordinate, and help improve the operations work being done across the AWS seller</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; organization.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; We are a growing organization tasked with solving complex business problems by</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; building scalable engineering solutions to give AWS sellers the biggest competitive</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; advantage. We encourage and support our engineers to think big and innovate on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; behalf of our customers.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Learn and Be Curious. We have a formal mentor search application that lets you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; find a mentor that works best for you based on location, job family, job level</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; etc. Your manager can also help you find a mentor or two, because two is better</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; than one. In addition to formal mentors, we work and train together so that we</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; are always learning from one another, and we celebrate and support the career</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; progression of our team members.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Instead, we’re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and well-balanced life—both in and outside of work.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Oh boy, what have I gotten myself into? Well, I figured I could learn more about</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the job and get my original questions answered in this interview. I go to the interview</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+on Chime but in the beginning have trouble getting my external camera to work.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I spent probably 15 minutes trying to figure this out, and ended up eating into the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+interview time despite joining early. It turns out that my privacy controls somehow</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+make Chime not happy, so I had to disable a lot of them... and also use my laptop&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+built-in camera. The interviewing engineer was patiently (I assume) waiting. Oh</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+well, I get the question and type up an answer. The question is one of the one in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+[exercises](/exercises). I think I finished in less than 10 minutes. She mentions</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+no one has finished so quickly and I&#x27;ve probably passed as long as the recruiter</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+likes the feedback she would pass along (why would the recruiter have a say on the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+technical aspect?) Turns out there is nothing else to the interview so I&#x27;m free</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to ask questions with the 45 minutes left. I quickly learn that the engineer interviewing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+me is on-call, isn&#x27;t even on the team that I&#x27;m being pushed towards, and can&#x27;t answer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+any of my questions. I do a quick search on her and find out she&#x27;s been at Amazon</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for 5 years, spending 3 years on one team and 2 on her current one. That&#x27;s a pretty</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+long tenure for Amazon. I end up chatting with her about Amazon&#x27;s remote policies,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+high turnover rate, and some general things like being on-call. I decide to end</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the meeting after 15 or so more minutes and comment that it&#x27;s always great when</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+meetings go under their planned duration and wish her a good lunch.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+November 8 rolls around and I get a response from the recruiter.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I hope you had a great weekend. I’ve received feedback from the Phone Interview</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and it looks great.  Wanted to check in with you to diuscuss next steps and scheduling</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; an on-site (virtual) interview. Let me know if you have time to talk today or</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; tomorrow. Let me know what your availability looks like.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I give him some pretty large time periods for when I&#x27;m available because full remote</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+benefits, but also express my concern about not knowing what the job actually entails</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+due to the super generic description.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+He responds on November 10th, and gives me some solid project examples for various</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+teams, but not the one that the job description was for. We end up on an interesting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+call which actually ends up being the final bit of communication. I opened up the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+call by saying I still do not know what the job entails, and then I have to tell</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+him that it was about the WWRO organization. Then he sets some tentative dates for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the final interview (December 1st) and goes over the format which is like 6-8 interviewers</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for a total of 4-5 hours. He also mentions some weekly call where I can ask questions</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that I might have about the final interview process. Talk about complex. At this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+point I&#x27;m pretty invested (as in I&#x27;ve made it this far with no prep, might as well</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+yolo the last interview too) and say ok, let&#x27;s do it. And that&#x27;s really the last</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+time I heard from him. I sent a follow up email on November 17th but have received</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+nothing.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Overall? I think it was a neutral or neutral/bad experience, mainly because of the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ghosting in the end. If I did put as much preparation as the recruiter was pushing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+me to put in, then it would definitely be very bad. I estimate my time spent to be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+around 4 hours - 1.5 hours for the interviews, 1 hour for my call to the recruiter</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for a casual chat, 1 hour for the recruiter calling me to set things up, and 30 minutes</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for emailing and other stuff. That&#x27;s like $300-$400 that Amazon owes me!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+A funny but dark joke I thought of one day was that maybe I was literally</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ghosted - couple the fact that on all of our calls the recruiter coughed a lot,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+had a doctor&#x27;s visit a few weeks back, and we&#x27;re in a pandemic... yes maybe that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was the case. No offense of course, I&#x27;m just making a hypothesis based on some random</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+observations I made.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+*Email names/wording are modified for privacy*</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Recently I received an email from an Amazon recruiter out of the blue.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; My name is R, and I am an Engineering Recruiter for Amazon’s Amazon Web Services</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; (AWS).  After reading through your profile, I wanted to reach out to you today.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Today I am reaching out because I’m looking for Software Development Engineer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; (SDE)’s for various locations.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; We have pre-scheduled interview slots that are coming up, and as I read through</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; your profile, I wanted to make sure you were considered for one of our opportunities.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; If you are interested in learning more about some of these opportunities, I’d</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; like to move you to our next step of the process.  Please let me know if you are</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; interested.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I appreciate your time, and I do hope to hear back from you.  Please let me know</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; if you have any questions.  Thanks!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The first thing that caught my attention is that I have an actual profile out there</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and that this was sent to a specific email that I used several years ago. The significance</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of the email is that I use many emails set up in a tree like structure, such that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+all emails are forwarded to the root email, I create new emails that forward to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the root and periodically nest the tree under a new root email. This means I have</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a general idea of where someone got an email based on the receiver - in this case</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the email was from a few years ago and job search related, interesting.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Furthermore, I (kind of) meticulously scrub my data after my search is finished</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+which technically should leave no information online anymore, but as we all know</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it&#x27;s still out there somewhere and I was curious to know where so I could delete</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Another thing I noted is that this message used two spaces after every period, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+suggested that it was manually typed up by an older person and not a template. I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+also took the liberty of looking up the recruiter on LinkedIn and it looks like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+he&#x27;s been doing technical recruiting for a couple decades but moved to at Amazon</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+recently.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Also, the email was sent at around 12am west coast time. I figure he&#x27;s trying to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+meet some kind of deadline for filling up the candidate pipeline and I might as well</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+see if I can help somehow even if I&#x27;m not really interested.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Because of these things, and the fact that I&#x27;m pretty starved socially (maybe enough</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to try to start a casual conversation with a *recruiter*, see previous posts), I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+decided to respond.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Thanks for reaching out. I&#x27;m not actively looking for a new position at the moment</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; but might be interested in a change under the right circumstances. Any information</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; about the opportunities would be greatly appreciated.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; My only specific question at the moment is what profile did you read?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The response:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Thanks for the response.  I saw both profile in a job site, and also looking at</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; an old resume of yours.  Based on that, made me want to try and reach out. Wasn’t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; sure what you’ve been doing since, or if it be a fit…but never hurts to try.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I work with a few different teams, mostly an innovation SDE team within Amazon’s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; AWS.  Below I’m including an example of a job description.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Job Description: [url](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1237225/software-development-engineer)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; If you have gone the SDE path, and you feel there is a fit and interest, let me</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; know.  I’d be happy to start the process.  Or talk more about it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Hmm, unfortunately no specific info on where the profile is, but what I did learn</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+is that Amazon somehow has one of my old resumes on file. I don&#x27;t remember applying</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for any jobs at Amazon before so I went to look at any past emails. Turns out I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+had another Amazon recruiter contact me a few years back.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I&#x27;d like to consider you for a full-time Software Development Engineering role</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; with our People Technology team at Amazon! We are looking for an enthusiastic</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; technologist with experience building global software solutions at massive scale.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; As a key member of our Analytics and ML technology team, you’ll work closely along</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; with our Principle SDE and Sr. Engineers in designing a strategy to detect and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; correct errors in existing and new Time and Attendance systems. In this role,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; you’ll have the opportunity to have a global impact on a Greenfield project involving</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; cutting-edge AWS technologies, data analytics, and machine learning. If you’re</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; an Engineer who can take a complicated problem, Think Big, Invent and Simplify,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and deliver it to Production with full autonomy, then this is the place for you!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; If you’re interested in being considered, please send along your resume. I will</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; personally review your resume along with the hiring team and follow up with next</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; steps.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Decided to look at this person&#x27;s LinkedIn now, and it looks like they&#x27;ve since moved</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+from Amazon and are now a sr techincal recruiter at Facebook. The interesting thing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+here is that he was asking for a resume, and I never responded - so I don&#x27;t think</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this is how Amazon picked up one of my old resumes. So then where did they get it?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Privacy leak nightmare, I suppose - most job search websites seem to be extremely</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+shady and spam you with &quot;job&quot; opportunities; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they sold</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+my resume.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Anyways, back to the recent recruiter, here&#x27;s a the job description in case it ever</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+changed or the url dies:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&quot;Join our team as we build brand-new solutions for smart energy, unlocking the potential</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of machine learning and IoT to meet the demands of tomorrow’s net carbon zero</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+market.&quot; Hmm, yes, pitching a job related to the environment is a good way to hook</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+zoomers i.e. me, I guess. Unfortunately I failed to see the connection between AWS</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and this and mentioned so in my response. I assumed it was like professional/managed</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+services for energy sector customers. I don&#x27;t really know much of AWS outside of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the fact that it provides computing resources/platforms.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Haha, a resume from YYYY or before sounds about right and yes, I&#x27;ve been doing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; software engineering work since then.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Working on improving energy efficiency sounds interesting and meaningful to me</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; but I don&#x27;t necessarily see the connection to AWS. Could you elaborate on the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; job description?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; I see this is a Seattle based position, are there any other options? Full disclosure,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; my current job is fully remote (although coincidentally also has an office in Seattle)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; with flexible hours, and I am a little averse towards relocating at the moment.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Other than that, I just have a general set of questions that I usually like to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; learn about any new opportunities:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; - Locations/remote work policy</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; - Work life balance</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; - Engineering culture</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - How much time is spent between meeting/working for engineers/what periodic</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;       meetings are there</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - How is work planned and distributed to the team?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Overall process from writing code to landing it in production (tests, code</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;       review, etc)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Team/management structure</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Some real examples of bugs/features that are being worked</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Any on-call responsibilities</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Mentorship and knowledge transfer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;     - Visibility of non-engineering departments</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; - Compensation</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; If it&#x27;s easier to get these answered by starting the process, then sign me up.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Before sending this response, I already erred towards not going for the opportunity</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+as it seemed like too much of a hastle for a small bump in compensation for a lot</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+lower quality of life and the actual work was still unclear. For these reasons,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I decided to lay out my hand with the full disclosure sentence.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, I think I showed too much and the recruiter never responded. Which kind of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+sucks because I wanted to talk to someone at AWS and ask why it&#x27;s so hard to figure</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out a list of services you&#x27;re running before you get billed, especially when one</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of the core values is Customer Obsessed. Let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s because they make</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+more money this way. In fact, based on my experience, maybe people are happier when</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+they ask for and get the refund compared to never having to ask for it in the first</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+place - creating fake friction which they can easily solve. And then there would</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+be people who are (over)billed and say nothing.</span>
