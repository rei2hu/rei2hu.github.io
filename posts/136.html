<p>When I look at recent events and the current state of things, I feel like I've dodged many bombs through inaction (or even laziness!)</p>
<p>Of course, conversely, I have also missed many opportunities, and I can't truly evaluate the value of things that didn't happen against things that actually happened.</p>
<p>I will not elaborate.</p>
<p>There is the saying that the grass is greener on the other side, and maybe it is, but I think I'm content with what I have for now. Or, you know, I'm too risk-averse to make any big moves currently.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I do think what I've achieved so far with my relatively slow and risk free life is a lofty goal for the average person.</p>
