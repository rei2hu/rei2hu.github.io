<h1 id=yet-another-life-introspective>yet another life introspective</h1>
<p>I swear I'll stop writing so many non-technical things. Soon.</p>
<p>Something funny happened over the past few weeks - I've literally lost all interest in my past hobbies. Video games, watching videos, etc. all do not give me any sense of happiness anymore.</p>
<p>Nowadays my days follow a pretty set schedule: working between 8-4 or 9-5 depending on when I feel like starting work, then heading out for a 2 hour+ walk around the neighborhood, then maybe dinner, and finally wasting away until bed time.</p>
<p>The funny thing is I don't feel as poor as before, I'm just straight up bored. The walks are pretty good as a time filler as I get lost in thought and time passes quickly. Oh, the exercise is good for me, too, I guess.</p>
<p>As for wasting time away, unfortunately it seems that reaching out to people a few years after not talking through email is not a good method. Well maybe they died of Covid, who knows? Kind of like when some of my online friends say "See you tomorrow" and I never see them ever again. I'm kind of falling into that category as I realized it was the common interest in video games and things that supported most of my online friendships and, without any interest from me, they are slowly crumbling.</p>
<p>I also decided to practice a few languages through Duolingo (not sponsored btw). Spanish to make up for my two C's in Spanish 2 and 3 (was one of them a D? I don't remember, how do you learn a language without studying anyways) and Chinese becauseâ€¦ take a guess. No doubt there is some hubbub around the effectiveness of Duolingo, but I think it suits my needs which is just to learn vocabulary. Unfortunately their placement tests seems to be suited towards beginners and only places more advanced users so far - right now I'm stuck learning things I already know despite more or less perfect scores on those tests. Oh well, a review isn't too bad.</p>
<p>I think I'm also planning to purchase some violin stuff to play again. Did I already mention this before or was it just on my mind for a while? Is this the Covid brain fog that people talk about? Probably not, I think general confusion about myself is just one of my characteristics.</p>
<p>Overall, I like to think that I must've lucked out somehow. Spending over a decade in front of a computer for 8-10 hours a day must have finally reduced any fun I get out of doing so. And now as a "young adult" I get to spend my time doing more productive activities like exercising, practicing foreign languages, and playing instruments? Well I write these too, it's pretty fun - but most of the thinking for the writing actually happens during walks. So maybe I won't stop writing these that soon.</p>
