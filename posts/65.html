<h1 id=setting-up-an-os-on-removable-media>setting up an os on removable media</h1>
<p>Specifically related to a 250GB Framework storage expansion card I was convinced to purchase alongside the laptop. I assume it works similar to any other removable media.</p>
<p>TLDR: Make sure the bootloader file is loaded in <code>/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi</code> (or maybe a different file name depending on architecture). This can be accomplished when installing GRUB by including the <code>--removable</code> flag.</p>
<p>This is the "fallback" boot loader which is intended for removable media, and works great with the expansion card. I guess I could have achieved similar outcomes with an external usb but the expansion card is integrated in the frame of the laptop itself - there may be some BIOS settings around boot order that you may need to mess with to get a nice startup but otherwise steps are literally the same as setting up a normal Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Below is a rough outline of steps based on the Arch Linux installation guide (I use arch btw):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Load installation media</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>fdisk -l</code> to figure out which device is the storage card. For me it was
<code>/dev/sda</code></p></li>
<li><p>Partition the drive into EFI, swap, and Linux partitions</p>
<ol>
<li>I prefer <code>cfdisk</code> because I don't know the <code>fdisk</code> commands.</li>
<li>You can follow the Arch Linux suggested partitions. The partition names will be used in the rest of the steps.</li>
<li>Make sure to toggle bootable for the EFI System partition.</li></ol>

<li><p>Format the partitions</p>

<li>Create a file system for the Linux partition via <code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3</code></li>
<li>Set up swap via <code>mkswap /dev/sda2</code></li>
<li>Format the EFI System partition <code>mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1</code></li></ol></li>
<li><p>Mount the file systems</p>
<ol>
<li><code>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt</code></li>
<li><code>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot</code></li></ol></li>
<li><p>Change root into system with <code>arch-chroot /mnt</code></p></li>
<li><p>Install GRUB via
<code>grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB --removable</code>. Don't forget <code>--removable</code>!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you do other steps like installing network related packages and actually setting up Linux/GRUB. If everything is done correctly, you should be able to boot without the installation media and get the GRUB bootloader to show when starting up (see BIOS menus around boot order, or try the one time boot override with F12 to see if there's an entry for it). You may also want to add an entry for your original OS so you may boot it while the storage card is attached.</p>
<p>This setup allows loading the bootloader on the expansion card when it is attached but otherwise loads bootloaders found on the laptop's storage when it is removed. Hmm, very much like a CDâ€¦ Do those still exist? Would it be possible to add a menu entry for the OS located on the expansion card to the laptop's boot loader? Possibly, but this way is cooler because you won't have a dead entry unless the card is attached I guess.</p>
