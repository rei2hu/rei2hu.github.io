Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX and TikZ diagrams, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=review-of-my-haskell-project>review of my haskell project</h1>
<p>I think I'm more or less finished with my game, and here is the review:</p>
<p>The programming of the game was a good way to learn the basics of developing with Haskell. I've (re)learned how to use various tools while working with the language including <code>stack</code>, <code>hlint</code>, and <code>brittany</code> (mainly because I'm too lazy to follow a consistent style when programming so if I can hit one or two keys to format my code, I'm a happy person).</p>
<p>Furthermore, I was able to use several libraries and learn how to read documentation for Haskell projects. Mainly I used <code>containers</code> for a hash table and <code>gloss</code> for graphics. I also got some good experience using <code>hoogle</code> to look for functions.</p>
<p>However, there were also some problems with this project. First I'll start with some generic things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I had a hard time organizing my code</p>
<ul>
<li>Basically I started out with a few top level files just so I could get things rolling quickly, then moved them to their respective folders later. However, as I found the need to make more files, I was not sure if the current structure was good.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>I did not have a clear idea of the game</p>
<ul>
<li>When I first started writing the game, all I had in mind was colors and a board with hexagonal tiles. I basically came up with the rest of the mechanics while writing which could have contributed to my problems in point 1.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Now for Haskell specific things, I think that the game was just too simple to allow me the opportunity to implement instances for typeclasses. Only once did I implement <code>Functor</code> only to realize that it was unnecessary one or two days later. Oh also I didn't test it, although I do have some previous things Haskell things which include tests.</p>
<p>If I had to rate the effectiveness of this experience, I would give it a 6/10. However, it may be possible to fill in the missing gaps without doing another project; looking at already existing Haskell code could give good insight for these things. Also I'm most definitely missing a lot of other stuff that I'm unaware of because I've only just touched the surface of the language.</p>
<p>Now bringing it all back to entry 2: Why learn Haskell? So far I cannot think of many new reasons outside of the previously given:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functional<ul>
<li>Being exposed to different programming paradigms is most likely very valuable as it gives a broader view of computer science/programming as a whole</li></ul></li>
<li>No boilerplate<ul>
<li>If you are aware of at least some of the language constructs, you can cut down on a lot of code that you would have to write using other languages</li></ul></li>
<li>Statically typed<ul>
<li>I didn't have to worry about too many runtime errors because the compiler would either error out or complain</li></ul></li>
<li><del>Sound smart</del>Review/learn concepts<ul>
<li>That was a joke point originally but Haskell seems to place more emphasis on various concepts that imperative programming languages barely touch - monads, type inference, lazy eval - granted this is common in most, if not all, functional languages.</li></ul></li>
