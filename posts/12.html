<h1 id=start-with-a-statically-typed-language>start with a statically typed language</h1>
<p>This is my opinion.</p>
<p>In the context of learning programming and computer science, it is best to start with a statically and strongly typed language. Dynamically typed languages are touted as offering higher productivity and easier to write but these things are not important to the novice programmer.</p>
<p>One of the most popular languages to start out with according to the internet happens to be python which is kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum here (although it is strongly typed). A few reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy syntax</li>
<li>Versatile</li>
<li>Good documentation/community</li>
</ol>
<p>I cannot give a beginner's eye on these reasons but, personally, I do not think the syntax is that much easier than what can be found in other languages - unless you count the boilerplate setup that comes with many compiled languages which shouldn't matter as it's not much noise. In terms of versatility, this is also something a beginner should not be too interested in - yes, python is used in various fields like machine learning, web development, data science, game development, etc. but this is not something that someone looking to learn solid fundamentals should be concerned about. The community is a good reason though, because it's good to have support as you learn.</p>
<p>However, a statically and strongly typed language provides one huge and important benefit that carries over to programming with other types of languages.</p>
<h2 id=learn-to-solve-your-own-errors>learn to solve your own errors</h2>
<p>In some of my free time, I help beginner programmers troubleshoot their issues and this errors that are provided an overwhelming amount of time are ones like this</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-12-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-12-1></label><code>(<span class=hljs-attr>node</span>:<span class=hljs-number>28176</span>) <span class="class_ hljs-title">UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning</span>: <span class="class_ hljs-title">TypeError</span>: <span class="class_ hljs-title">Cannot</span> read property <span class=hljs-string>&#x27;name&#x27;</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>of</span> <span class=hljs-literal>undefined</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-12-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-12-2></label><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File <span class=hljs-string>&quot;f.py&quot;</span>, line <span class=hljs-number>21</span>, <span class=hljs-keyword>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: <span class=hljs-string>&#x27;Block&#x27;</span> <span class=hljs-built_in>object</span> has no attribute <span class=hljs-string>&#x27;length&#x27;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>First things first, it is interesting to see how many people either do not understand what this kind of error message means or do not read.</p>
<p>I've tackled so many issues with this problem and 99% of the time it is due to not understanding types. Someone is using a variable and doesn't understand that the data represented by the variable is a certain type with certain properties and methods and is trying to access some arbitrary property that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>So much time could be saved if the programmer just kept this in mind - and this idea is actually forced upon you when you use a statically typed language because the types need to be known before run time, so you wouldn't even be able to run the program without getting this right.</p>
<p>Furthermore, understanding types is a roadway to understanding classes and reading documentation. When you understand that a variable is of a certain type, you can pull up the documentation of the class or struct and see what properties and methods exist on it.</p>
<p>And on a slightly unrelated note, being able to search documentation <strong>by types</strong> is a huge feature. I mean, have you tried out
<a href=https://hoogle.haskell.org/ >Hoogle</a>?</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>conclusion</h2>
<p>Many trivial errors that are encountered by novice programmers could be avoided if they started out with a strongly, statically typed language. If one plans to surpass the level of copying code off of examples and making slight modifications to writing their own, the fundamentals conferred through the use of such a language is indispensable in helping you do so.</p>
<p>Once you have a solid understanding of types after getting beat up by the type checker, you will be able to keep the concept in mind as you work with dynamically typed languages which have no such support yet will give you errors if you make the same mistake.</p>
<p>Think of it as starting out with training wheels - you go a little slower but are safer and able to build up a good understanding - and then you take them off and are able to keep your balance (not make novel errors due to mismatched types).</p>
<p>I wouldn't suggest starting with Haskell though, the syntax is a lot different from what is usually found in imperative programming languages.</p>
