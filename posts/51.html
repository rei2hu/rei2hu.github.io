<h1 id=what-being-on-call-is-like>what being on call is like</h1>
<p>So my current job requires all engineers to be on call based on a rotation and I've been through it a few times. While on call experiences will definitely differ from company to company, mine has been pretty chill.</p>
<p>Overall, our systems are pretty stable so I haven't had to do anything out of the ordinary - I also trust the system to work a lot. The main difference is a small amount of worry that, for some reason, one of two things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Miss getting paged, then entire team gets paged</li>
<li>The mitigation steps are non-trivial</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1, as the on call engineer, it should be my duty to respond to things. So I have to keep an eye on your computer (or phone), which means less restful sleeps. For 2, I'd just feel bad that I would have to call in other engineers and also spend a lot of time trying to fix the problem (ie outage). Even in this case, it's more of an irrational worry because the following analysis should be blameless and might not even be my fault. I've only been paged a few times and the errors were transient so a quick restart was a working solution.</p>
<p>In general, on call isn't too bad if the system isn't a dumpster fire I guess.</p>
