<h1 id=figured-out-i-have-a-facebook>figured out I have a facebook</h1>
<p>I was taking a look at some old emails and realized I never deleted a Facebook account I made several years ago. I took the liberty of logging in to delete it.</p>
<p>For some info, I had &lt;10 friends, posts, and photos (my 1 photo was actually just a solid color used for my profile picture). Before deleting it, I took the liberty of looking at my suggested friends as it caught my eye at the time.</p>
<p>I think the accuracy was quite good for such little information, however it mainly suggested people from high school, and over 50% of the friends I had added were from my high school so that's probably where the accuracy came from. It also suggested a lot of people I did not recognize, though - some with which I have no mutual friends with.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to think of it, however, hopefully, I can rest with the fact that my account will be deleted by the end of next month. It's quite unfortunate that Facebook has its track record regarding privacy, because I can see how useful it is for keeping up with others, which is the main reason I was going backwards through my emails anyways - to find people to talk to.</p>
<p>Then again, I guess various email service providers also "read" your email, too. Privacy truly is a losing battle. Well, I can at least kind of rest knowing that attempts at searching my real name and various details turn up minimum information.</p>
