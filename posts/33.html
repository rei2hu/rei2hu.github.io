<h1 id=natural-disasters>natural disasters</h1>
<p>Here I am, stuck in the path of a natural disaster and based on what I've read, it's a bad one. I guess I have a non-zero chance of dying.</p>
<p>Well, with my current attitude towards life it doesn't seem to be a big deal, although my apathy may change in my final moments - if I get to experience them. That isn't to say that I wouldn't have evacuated given the chance, but rather I don't mind either outcome. Note that the main reason I didn't evacuate was because this was a sudden (relatively speaking) occurrence and should have been a much less severe natural disaster.</p>
<p>Even then, perhaps I've just grown old and stubborn. Hey, at least I have an excuse to not go into work. Actually last week was the first week I thought to myself "dang it's Saturday, which means tomorrow is Sunday, and the day after that I have to work." Hmm, doesn't seem like I'm getting better.</p>
<p>Anyways, the main reason I wanted to write this was to create a potential last post type deal. Lack of closure is something that's quite disappointing - and if anyone ever comes across these posts, I'd like to close them properly. If nothing else is posted after this, then chances are I died. Unfortunate.</p>
<p>I expect to be in range in a few hours or so, so wish me and everyone around this area good luck. Right now I'm quite comfortable, and I assume it won't be the case then. Interesting how things have the potential to change so quickly.</p>
<p>This might have been a little too melodramatic.</p>
