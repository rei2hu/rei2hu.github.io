<p>Recently I came across a simple problem which was to get the average time something lived given it's replacement schedule. For example we might be given a data like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Part</th>
<th>Replaced On</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part A</td>
<td>Oct 7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part B</td>
<td>Oct 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part B</td>
<td>Oct 4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part B</td>
<td>Oct 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part B</td>
<td>Oct 9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>something</td>
<td>Part B</td>
<td>Oct 12</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If we were to calculate the average time for Part A, we would calculate the time between each replacement for a specific part, add them up, and divide by the number of those values. This ends up being an average of 1 day because</p>
<table>

<th>Duration</th>

<p>This is great and all but then I realized the basic formula to get the sum of the intervals in between the values is something like $(x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_n - x_{n - 1}) = (x_n - x_1)$ where $x_n$ is the value of the $n$th entry</p>
<p>If we apply that to the above, we get Oct 7 - Oct 1 which is 6, the sum we got earlier, which we then divide by $n - 1$ for the average of 1. Weirdly enough, I think I was lucky to realize this as the original formula is simple enough to write and I wouldn't have bothered looking for any optimizations.</p>
<p>Even at first glance, it was interesting that it boiled down to this but after a quick visualization it makes perfect sense. Here is what it might look like for Part B.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-19-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-19-1></label><code>Oct 1

|###        |
    ##      |
      ###   |
         ###|
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the length of the intervals in between ends up being the length between the start and end (again, very obvious now but I don't know how I never realized it before). And then we can get the average which is 11 / 4.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm pretty sure I've come across similar problems about the sum of intervals in a set of numbers but I never actually had this realization because I wasn't looking closely.</p>
<p>It's interesting how things like this might be overlooked when something already start out looking simple.</p>
<p>And then I realized that the easiest way to think about this is to just say you replaced an item x times over a period of time, so that just means that on average each item lasted for $(\text{period of time}) / (\text{times replaced} + 1)$.</p>
