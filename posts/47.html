<h1 id=use-of-type-fields>use of type fields</h1>
<p>One thing I've noticed in a few bits of code over the past few years is the use of a <code>type</code> field to determine the true type of an object. For example, we are working at a pet store and are tasked with creating a class to represent cats and dogs, so we make an <code>Animal</code> class. We also determine a few properties that both cats and dogs share and have them in that class.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-47-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-47-1></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>public</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>enum</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">AnimalType</span> {
    CAT,
    DOG,
    ;
}

<span class=hljs-keyword>class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span> {
    AnimalType type;
    <span class=hljs-type>float</span> price;
    <span class=hljs-type>int</span> numLegs;
    <span class=hljs-type>int</span> tailLength;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, that's good and all. Or is it? Let's say now our pet store starts to stock fish, how would we go about updating our code to reflect this? Well, we figure out what kind of data we want about the fish and add <code>FISH</code> to the enum.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-47-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-47-2></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>public</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>enum</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">AnimalType</span> {
    CAT,
    DOG,
    FISH,
    ;
}

<span class=hljs-keyword>class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span> {
    AnimalType type;
    <span class=hljs-type>float</span> price;
    <span class=hljs-type>int</span> numLegs;
    <span class=hljs-type>double</span> tailLength;
    <span class=hljs-type>int</span> numFins;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmâ€¦ immediately we should see an issue where if we use the <code>Animal</code> class to represent a fish, <code>numLegs</code> ends up being an extraneous field. Furthermore, we don't have any nice type checks when working with the class.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-47-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-47-3></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>if</span> (animal.type == AnimalType.FISH) {
    <span class=hljs-comment>// fish have legs?</span>
    System.out.println(<span class=hljs-string>&quot;This fish has &quot;</span> + animal.numLegs + <span class=hljs-string>&quot; legs!&quot;</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this kind of thing falls under the category of "untagged union" where we have to use application level logic to determine the true data stored in something, but it doesn't line up with the Wikipedia definition so I'm not so sure. This is a simple example to see the issue, but might be harder to see when dealing with more complex business logic. We should be interested in the proper way to write this.</p>
<p>Instead of having a <code>type</code> field, we should take advantage of actual types. We should take advantage of inheritance/polymorphism to do this; I feel like most intro to programming classes cover this, and it's one of those things that I never came across or thought about before my formal CS education.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-47-4 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-47-4></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>abstract</span> <span class=hljs-keyword>class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span> {

    <span class=hljs-type>double</span> tailLength;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is just the minimum and we can make things more complex with more layers in the hierarchy since we see shared properties among the various subtypes, but that's more of a judgment call or kind of a "we need more info" situation. Either way, we can now take advantage of types.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-47-5 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-47-5></label><code><span class=hljs-keyword>if</span> (animal <span class=hljs-keyword>instanceof</span> Fish) {

<p>I find this interesting because a while back I remember one of my university colleagues was complaining about an interview question where they were asked: "What is polymorphism?" and we all thought that was funny because not many people were familiar with the word, but after looking it up we realized it was just talking about things like inheritance which we were familiar with.

<p>My other thought is around the interaction between databases and application code; when it comes to databases, I don't think there is any true way to model variants so you'll very often see a table with a type column with fields that may or may not be applicable. And then if you have to manually write the conversion methods, it's slightly easier to design a class that you can stuff the entire row into rather than several classes to specifically pick which fields should be taken. Of course, it might be easier to avoid this with the use of ORMs but those kind of cause their own class of problems too.</p>
<p>There is also a problem around modeling these types of relationships in frontend components which also kind of don't support true inheritance but instead rely on composability that I half want to write something about but opted not to so I'm just leaving this sentence as a note down here.</p>
