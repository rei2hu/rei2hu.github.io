<p>So, if you don't know, I enjoy old-school Maplestory. And a couple of years ago a project known as Yeou was publicized.</p>
<p>The innovative thing here was the client, which was rewritten in such a way that it supported multiple compilation targets including web (via wasm).</p>
<p>As such, I tried the game back then and it had issues during alpha as expected:</p>
<p><img alt="packet fail" src=/blobs/88/packetfail.png></p>
<p>But still somewhat worked (I was playing with a friend and we would always disconnect when entering the same map)</p>
<p><img alt="random gameplay screenshot" src=/blobs/88/fun.png></p>
<p>A few things I noted while testing the application was the use of canvas for the graphics, websocket for the connection, and how it downloaded what looked like official assets off of some cdn each time you loaded the game. Not ideal, so I thought I would give it some time and check in on it later, and it did improve over time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was too much pressure from somewhere, and four days after the beta test on November 25, one of the two developers on the project shared the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@everyone Hi friends, I have some very bad news. It seems like the beta launch went a little too well. For a little backstory, back in march this year we got our first DMCA takedown for the web version of the game (web.yeou.app). This was a little earlier than we expected as it was still a fairly small alpha test, but we had some plans for this in case it happened and that seemed to go well for a while. A bit before the beta dropped we got another one, for the actual website this time (www.yeou.app). We figured this might fizzle out like the last one did so we ignored it.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the beta launch itself and it seems someone lit a fire under their asses because during the launch days we got a DMCA targeted towards the various auxiliary services we use (the data CDN and the game server itself). And then today I got a message through another DMCA towards something that's supposed to be 'protected', that they are pursuing further steps in obtaining my information and legal action. And after some verification, this is now more than just a simple DMCA. I'll be honest, with how long the server has lasted, at the start I never really thought about going really hard on opsec because I would have never expected it to get this far and them going this hard. And that's definitely my fault, but there's no turning that back with how unique the project is.</p>
<p>All this lands us at a crossroads. I'm beyond happy with how the project has gone so far and with the work we put in I would absolutely hate to throw it all away, but on the other hand I know this is a battle we can't win because of earlier mistakes and how hard they're pressing. The timing is awful, but that is probably for a reason. I feel like the launch made them realize the potential of the project and they felt like they had to really do something or make an example out of it. We were hoping by being different enough from the original, and being purely a passion driven fan game that they would hopefully be more lenient but it seems like it's the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Yeou truly felt like something special to me. It was something we could pour all of our creativity into and make something beautiful out of a game we have loved since we were young. I've always loved the game and was fully willing to spend many more years of my free time and thousands more of my own money making it into something to have people relive that game in a more fun, social, and accessible way. Unfortunately it didn't get to be that way and we're forced to shut it down.</p>
<p>The server will turn off tomorrow at the same time the beta came out, and I will try to keep the Discord around. I wish I could see what it could have become, but we will be leaving the Maple scene and moving on to bigger and better things (maybe ones that are actually marketable and possibly a smarter investment of time ðŸ˜…). I'm truly sorry and thank you all so much for playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see the cdn complying because they were hosting official content, but I'm not so sure about the rest of the things as the client and server are supposedly reversed/written from scratch. And even worse, none of the work is planned to be open sourced.</p>
<p>Why did this DMCA work on this server when there are other much longer lived servers? Based on the above quote, the developer doesn't have anonymity so whoever is going after them (Nexon?) was able to tie things to their real world identity.</p>
<p>Sad timesâ€¦</p>
