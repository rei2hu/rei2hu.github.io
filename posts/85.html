<h1 id=the-urge-to-consume>the urge to consume</h1>
<p>Consume as in buy things; sorry for the clickbaity title.</p>
<p>I don't spend a lot of money outside of necessities, but when I do buy something, I feel the urge to buy more things - I'm not sure why that is.</p>
<p>For example, I needed a usb hub because my laptop only has 4 interchangeable ports. After some thorough research on price/quality ratios for different models, I went on Amazon and added it to my cart. Then I spent an hour or so window shopping on Amazon, flipping through various links, and looking for something to buy. It wasn't for any simple reason like trying to hit the free shipping limit, or looking for something I considered buying earlier - I was just looking for anything that I would want.</p>
<p>In my rational mind, I find this behavior wasteful and crazy, but yet I did it. Fortunately I have the restraint to <em>not</em> purchase anything but it's kind of crazy. I don't know if this is a normal thing to feel. Is this feeling instilled by the work of big evil companies and their hired behavioral scientists/psychologists? It's a scary thought!</p>
