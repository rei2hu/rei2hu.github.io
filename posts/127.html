<h1 id=puzzle-combinations>puzzle combinations</h1>
<p>I was thinking about gifts, and what makes a good gift. A couple years ago, I purchased a Lego set thinking it would be a great gift; it was a flower set which means you would spend some time putting it together and could put the completed piece on display like a houseplant.</p>
<p>I think it was received with a little ridicule (granted, this was a gift exchange for adults), but I was able to see the finished product recently when visiting. It looks nice in my opinion.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was thinking of gift ideas again, but this post isn't going to be about gift ideas. I thought of puzzles for a similar reason - some fun assembly then a finished product. Then my mind randomly wandered to thinking about the total number of puzzle piece configurations a puzzle could have.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, consider a rectangular puzzle with square-ish pieces with 4 sides, and each side either has a protruding part or aâ€¦ not-protruding part. Or is an edge. Of course, there are many ways this can be set up but let's just leave the classification simple with 2 (3) classes.</p>
<p>If a puzzle is x by y pieces, how many possible piece configurations are there?</p>
<p>At first glance, this was pretty difficult because the possible configurations of one piece depends on the surrounding ones. Maybe not too difficult because I already explained it in a way that makes what I thought of more obvious - each edge has 2 or 3 possibilities, so it's a simple combination problem depending on the number of edges in the puzzle.</p>
<p>For example a 2x2 puzzle has 4 non-side edges, so there should be 16 possible configurations. A 3x3 puzzle has 12 non-side edges, so there should be $2^{12}$ possible configurations.</p>
<p>Is it right? It seems plausible but I didn't check. I also haven't bothered figuring out a closed form solution for the number of non-side edges for this kind of puzzle given the sides.</p>
<p>Then you realize that some of the configurations could be considered the same as they're just rotations for each other. How do you account for that? Divide by 4?</p>
<p>Also in the meantime I decided to remove the puzzle section of my blog and instead incorporate the puzzle posts here. It kind of messes with the order and post dates but I can't insert them where they should belong without bumping the links of all the other posts so I'll eat it. This could be a good lesson into not having the post ids derived from the same data used to order the posts, but for more generic scenarios.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of manually breaking things up, I use a tagging system. If I ever feel like putting one together.</p>
