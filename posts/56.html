<h1 id=a-quick-hobby-project>a quick hobby project</h1>
<p>A few days ago I finished working on a small hobby project which was to implement the <a href=https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Paramedic>paramedic</a> side mission as a kind of race mode for <a href=https://multitheftauto.com/ >Multi Theft Auto (MTA)</a>.</p>
<p>It all started when a friend who plays MTA was asked for my help in regards to an existing script. As a non-spoon-feeder, I tried to push him towards the solution with a few hints but, as he is not a "coder", what should have taken 3 minutes ended up taking a little over 2 hours - which personally I didn't mind. We then spent some time chatting about unique races and how everything is lost to an old server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M: but that's a boring gimmic!!</p>
<p>M: there are some REALLY script heavy maps…</p>
<p>M: but they're gatekept on old server!!!</p>
<p>M: this is a split-off…</p>
<p>M: no active codemonkeys…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, the next day Paramedic is suggested so I start looking at the docs and see what's possible. Keep in mind that I do not actually own the game at this time. We end up spending 12 hours where I just come up with random code based on documentation and send it over to him as a text file to try. Eventually I think the progress is so slow (<em>cough</em> no progress <em>cough</em>) I get the game and start figuring out how to mod myself.</p>
<p>The main barrier for this game mode is that it relied on "randomized" checkpoints while the base gamemode's checkpoints were static ones defined in the map file. Furthermore, due to scoping, it was impossible to directly utilize any of the code that existed in the base gamemode. However, after a bit of sleuthing, I realized that the base gamemode came with the ability to trigger arbitrary functions through events - send an event with name of a function as a string and it might be called.</p>
<p>In my case, this was enough.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-56-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-56-1></label><code>triggerEvent(<span class=hljs-string>&quot;onClientCall_race&quot;</span>, root, <span class=hljs-string>&quot;checkpointReached&quot;</span>, element)
</code></pre>
<p>After that, everything is more or less smooth sailing. I kept track of all the game state in my own code and I was able to get the main logic out over the next few hours and got feedback from my friend 9 hours after getting the game.</p>
<p>We do a lot of single player testing and work out some bugs and exploits and eventually get it onto a server with a few players for a multiplayer test. This is when more issues were revealed:</p>
<ol>
<li>turns out when your ambulance blows up, it blows up anyone around you.</li>
<li>relying on a server provided time and a client provided time to draw some things didn't work nicely when you're not hosting locally.</li>
<li>players could toggle spectate mode to teleport somewhere (last saved position?) without losing anyone you've picked up</li>
</ol>
<p>1 was straightforward to fix after a little research, as you can just cancel the event so the server never processes it.</p>
<p>For 2 I ended up doing an entire rewrite where I moved all the logic to client - which I find is interesting as it's most likely much less secure. In fact, after browsing through a lot of MTA code and reading how things work, I realized that clients are actually the source of truth for a lot of things (client's can be "syncers" which mean they control and report the state of certain elements to the server).</p>
<p>3 was another dive into the base gamemode code. I eventually figured out that triggering spectator mode fired off a server event, which I made fire off a client event, which would reset your pickups as if you died.</p>
<p>The final thing I did was to split up the code in a way such that my friend was able to make small changes. While he can't code, he is able to make small adjustments to UI positioning that I don't care much for. The issue here is that we would just send a single file back and forth - if I made a change before he sent me his changes, I would just override his as I didn't want to bother doing a fancy merge. What I ended up doing was creating events that would trigger throughout the game and moved all the presentation logic into a separate file that only relied on those events. e.g.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-56-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-56-2></label><code>    triggerEvent(g_AMBULANCE_FULL_EVENT, localPlayer, <span class=hljs-literal>true</span>)

    <span class=hljs-comment>-- other file</span>

    addEvent(g_AMBULANCE_FULL_EVENT, <span class=hljs-literal>true</span>)
    addEventHandler(g_AMBULANCE_FULL_EVENT, localPlayer, <span class=hljs-function><span class=hljs-keyword>function</span><span class=hljs-params>(alreadyFull)</span></span>
        drawText(g_AMBULANCE_FULL_TEXT, <span class=hljs-number>3500</span>)
    <span class=hljs-keyword>end</span>)

    <span class=hljs-comment>-- rather than just drawText(g_AMBULANCE_FULL_TEXT, 3500) in the main file</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to write about this as it really highlights what I enjoy about coding - creating something that people enjoy and having basically full control over any internal details. Meanwhile I think work is soul sucking because if something is even remotely non-technical, I have to defer to someone else in the organization's opinions. It's quite ironic that my friend calls me a codemonkey when in reality I'm arguably more of a codemonkey at work.</p>
<p>Also, just to emphasize how much of a non-coder this friend is, we had this little exchange to fix a bug:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R: maybe off by 1 cuz i didnt want to make marker when checkpoint is at end</p>
<p>R: idk!</p>
