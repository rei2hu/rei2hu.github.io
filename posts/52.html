<p>Well, today one of my friends sent me a news link for a game we used to regularly play (I dropped out after a few years, but he kept playing).</p>
<p><a href=https://gameforge.com/en-GB/play/tera/news/dce17483-d9a7-4c92-92ad-a83f186067f8>https://gameforge.com/en-GB/play/tera/news/dce17483-d9a7-4c92-92ad-a83f186067f8</a></p>
<p>And just for archival's sake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TERA players,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we come bearing bad news: TERA’s developers, Bluehole, have decided to cease work on TERA. After much consideration, the team in South Korea have come to the conclusion that they are no longer able to offer you the exciting and satisfying content you deserve. As the last remaining publisher of TERA, it is with a heavy heart that we must respect Bluehole’s decision, and will also have to shut down the game. The TERA servers will be switched off at 10 AM CEST (4 AM EDT) on 30th June 2022. Until then, we’ll be running some permanent events, in the hope that you’ll at least be able to enjoy these final months in Arborea.</p>
<p>After nearly 10 long years, the TERA legend must sadly come to an end. Together we’ve braved so many of Arborea’s perils, fought valiantly against the argons, made many new friends and gone on countless adventures. We would like to thank you for your loyalty, for accompanying us on this long journey, and for being such an amazing community!</p>
<p>For more details regarding TERA’s shutdown, please read our FAQs.</p>
<p>Our days in Arborea may be numbered, but the next adventure is just over the horizon. We hope to see you again soon in one of our other games.</p>
<p>Until then! The TERA Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when did we play this game? Back in the 2016s - 2020s. Which is like 6 years ago… before university. It's kind of crazy to think that a game like half of my age is shutting down.</p>
<p>I didn't do much tooling around the game, but a few interesting notes: I once tried to reverse some of the client in order to create a chat relay between the game and a generic messaging platform. I ended up getting banned for some reason, and when I appealed I was asked where I was logging in from. Also one of the most interesting game related tools I've ever encountered was TERA proxy which just made everything client sided in a sense so you could play with a 0 ping feeling - a godsend for Americans playing on EU servers.</p>
<p>Honestly this is going to be the Maplestory post all over again so I'll cut it short. I had some nice experiences playing the game (I enjoy most games in general), and I wish I took more screenshots… Well it's not too late to get some technically but I don't want to download the game. Here are the few I was able to find:</p>
<p><img alt=crouch src=/blobs/52/crouch.jpg>
Here's my main character, a human brawler in a weird crouching position for some reason.</p>
<p><img alt=underground src=/blobs/52/underground.jpg> My secondary character, an elin mystic that fell under the map.</p>
<p><img alt=whale src=/blobs/52/whale.jpg> A character that I ended up deleting based on chat history, looking at the scenery and having a whale of a time.</p>
<p>The following screenshots are not mine, but were taken from my friend's point of view. <img alt=buta src=/blobs/52/buta.jpg> Another one of my characters, Buta, a Popori Priest can be barely seen.</p>
<p><img alt=fang src=/blobs/52/fang.jpg> Just some funny backstory, I was known as "fang" due to having fangay in my main character's name.</p>
<p><img alt=kavador src=/blobs/52/kavador.jpg> Completing the first boss of Velik's Hold Hard Mode (a 7 man dungeon) as a healer/tank duo with my friend.</p>
<p><img alt=whale2 src=/blobs/52/whale2.jpg> We sure had a whale of a time…</p>
<p>Always sad to see a game shut down and for all the work put into making it work behind it to just disappear. Hopefully it'll be kept alive through private servers.</p>
