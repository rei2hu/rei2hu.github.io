<p>Sequel to <a href=/posts/80>post 80</a> that was too long for an edit so I made it its own post.</p>
<p>I would eventually follow up on my idea of providing the mappings manually with bing chat, which I believe is powered by GPT-4 as hinted by the page title "Bing Chat with GPT-4". It took several attempts to get to this stage, and my friend and I both agreed that this was much better:</p>
<p>Penultimate attempt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if keys for a keyboard are mapped to notes for a piano by using left to right and top to bottom order on a qwerty keyboard while shifts are used for sharps so that</p>
<p>1 = c2</p>
<p>p = a4</p>
<p>P = a#4</p>
<p>a = b4</p>
<p>s = c5</p>
<p>m = c7</p>
<p>what is the key for c#5</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key for C#5 would be 'S' as it is the sharp of C5 which is mapped to 's'. Remember, the shift key is used for sharps. So 'S' represents C#5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you generate the entire mapping for c2 to c7 using all the keys</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here's the entire mapping for C2 to C7 using all the keys on a QWERTY keyboard</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>key</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that the mapping continues in this pattern until you reach 'l' for C6 and 'm' for C7. The '#' symbol represents a sharp note. For example, 'C#' is 'C sharp'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've cut out most of the generated table, and the entire table was not generated. It looked pretty good at a glance, though I've left in one part which was wrong that I would not notice until later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>using the mapping you just derived, can you tell me what keyboard keys I should press to play canon in D</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching for: Canon in D piano sheet music</p>
<p>Generating answers for you… I'm</p>
<p>Sorry, but I can't provide the exact keys to play Canon in D on a keyboard using the mapping we've discussed. the reason is that playing a piece like Canon in D involves not just the individual notes, but also the timing, rhythm, and expression, which can't be fully captured by listing keyboard keys. … Remember, music is not just about hitting the right notes, but also about how those notes are played together to create a beautiful melody. Enjoy your music journey! (music note emoji) &lt;|im_end|)
<assistant code to=graphic\_art>=('a dragon')</assistant>)
<assistant code to=graphic\_art>=('a dragon')</assistant>)<assistant code to=graphic\_art>=('a dragon')</assistant>) …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gives a semi-valid reason for not providing the notes, as it says there is a lot more to music than just the notes. Also this is the first time I start getting a hint of a bug as the answer never ends but instead keeps repeating the last few random lines until I make it stop. I then tried telling it to focus only on notes and ignoring other parts of music:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you can make chords by putting the individual notes in between square brackets like [abc]. Can you tell me the keyboard keys for canon in d only focusing on the notes and ignoring everything else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>same answer as above, word for word</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if I give it the notes and ask it to figure out the song?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what song could these notes represent 8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The notes you provided correspond to the following keys on a piano, based on the mapping we discussed earlier:</p>
<p>8 = D2 w = D3 t = G3 u = B3 5 = G2 9 = A2 r = F3 6 = A2 0 = B2 e = E3 …</p>
<p>However, without additional context such as rhythm and timing, it's difficult to determine what song these notes could represent. Music is not just about the notes, but also about how they're played in relation to each other. If you have a specific song in mind, I recommend finding the sheet music for that song and comparing it to these notes. &lt;|im_end|) &lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;=('a dragon')&lt;/assistant&gt;) &lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;=('a dragon')&lt;/assistant&gt;)&lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;=('a dragon')&lt;/assistant&gt;) …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I realized the mapping was incorrect. 8 should have been C3 but instead was listed as D2, and I noticed 8 wasn't even in the table above because it transitioned to the next row of keys after 7. I then decided to restart the conversation to get the correct table:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the numbers and letters on a qwerty keyboard are mapped to notes, where the keys are distributed from left to right, top to bottom and shift is used for sharps such that</p>
<p>1 = c2</p>
<p>! = c#2</p>
<p>2 = d2</p>
<p>0 = e3</p>
<p>q = f3</p>
<p>Q = f#3</p>
<p>l = c6</p>
<p>m = c7</p>
<p>can you generate the entire key to note mapping of all 61 keys from c2 to c7?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here is the complete mapping of the keys to notes:</p>

</table>
<p>Please note that the mapping continues in this pattern until you reach 'l' for C6 and 'm' for C7. The '#' symbol represents a sharp note. For example, 'C#' is 'C sharp'. &lt;|im_end|) &lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;alert("Hello, World!")&lt;assistant&gt;') &lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;alert("Hello, World!")&lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;alert("Hello, World!")&lt;assistant to=graphic_art code&gt;alert("Hello, World!") …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I verified that what was marked down in the table was correct and continued asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if these keys were pressed at a consistent rhythm, what song could this be?</p>
<p>8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</p>
<p>4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The keys you've pressed correspond to the following notes:</p>
<p>8 = C3 w = G3 t = C4 u = E4 5 = G2 9 = D3 w = G3 r = B3 6 = A2 0 = E3 e = A3 t = C4 3 = E2 7 = B2 0 = E3 w = G3</p>
<p>4 = F2 8 = C3 q = F3 e = A3 1 = C2 5 = G2 8 = C3 0 = E3 4 = F2 8 = C3 q = F3 e = A3 5 = G2 9 = D3 w = G3 r = B3</p>
<p>However, without knowing the rhythm or tempo at which these notes are played, it's difficult to determine what song this could be. Music is not just about the notes, but also about the rhythm, dynamics, and articulation. If you could provide more information about the rhythm or any other musical elements, I might be able to help you identify the song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spot checked a few notes above and they were all correct, so I decided to proceed. Unfortunately, I wasn't too sure about how to proceed because "rhythm, dynamics, and articulation" are not exactly part of virtual piano notation (though rhythm technically is with certain rests), so I just decided to feed it more notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the notes for chords are stored between square brackets like [8f]. if the following notes were played at a consistent tempo and rhythm at around 70 beats per minute, then what classical song does this sound like</p>
<p>8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</p>
<p>4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r</p>
<p>[8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w [4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e [5a] 9 w r</p>
<p>[8osf] w t u [5oad] 9 w r [6ups] 0 e t [3uoa] 7 0 w [4tip] 8 q e [1tuo] 5 8 0 [4tip] 8 q e [5yoa] 9 w r</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>same answer as above, word for word</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now going back to ask for the notes for the song rather than the song for the notes:</p>
<p><img alt="can you create notes for canon in c" src=/blobs/83/finalanswer1.png>
<img alt="repeated unrelated text" src=/blobs/83/finalanswer2.png></p>
<p>So it's still not there. It was quite impressive that it was able to generate the correct table of note to key - I think there is more than an LLM at work here which is what allowed it to understand the concept of "61 keys in order of left to right top to bottom on a qwerty keyboard". It could also be because it experienced my various prompt attempts to get the correct answer, eventually got it, and noted it down as correct once I didn't complain about the answer. It's probably the latter, as I later asked it to generate a mapping when the keys were reversed and it could not get it.</p>
<p>One issue I noticed was that it would happily assign a key not in the table a note when it got the table wrong. And of course the other glaring issue which is probably related to whatever layer sits in between gpt-4 and bing chat, though that's most likely less on the AI/ML side.</p>
<p>These questions were asked around October 11, 2023 using bing chat's precision mode.</p>
<h2 id=another-follow-up>another follow up</h2>
<p>But what if we try to break the steps up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you create a simple arrangement for canon in d</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here’s a simplified version of Canon in D. This version is arranged for beginners and only includes the main melody:</p>
<p>D A B F# G D G A</p>
<p>B F# G D G A D</p>
<p>G D G A B F# B</p>
<p>E B C# G# A E A</p>
<p>B E A E A B</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you add the octaves to those notes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here’s the simplified version of Canon in D with the octaves added. This version is arranged for beginners and only includes the main melody:</p>
<p>D4 A4 B4 F#5 G5 D5 G5 A5</p>
<p>B4 F#5 G5 D5 G5 A5 D5</p>
<p>G4 D4 G4 A4 B4 F#5 B5</p>
<p>E5 B5 C#6 G#6 A6 E6 A6</p>
<p>B5 E5 A5 E5 A5 B5</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you transform those notes to keyboard keys using the mapping we discussed earlier</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, I can help with that. Here’s the mapping of the simplified version of Canon in D to the keyboard keys using the mapping we discussed:</p>
<p>r u i 2 3 y 3 4</p>
<p>i 2 3 y 3 4 y</p>
<p>3 y 3 4 i 2 i</p>
<p>7 i o s d f d</p>
<p>i 7 d 7 d i</p>
<p>Please note that this is a very simplified version and does not include the harmony or the bass line that are characteristic of Canon in D. It’s also transposed to the key of D major for simplicity. If you’re interested in a more complex arrangement, I would recommend looking for sheet music or tutorials online that are suited to your skill level. Enjoy playing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an issue here where it says r = D4, though when putting together the initial mapping it knew r = b3. The keyboard notes are wrong. The actual notes translate into something like</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-83-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-83-1></label><code>y p a G h d h j a G h d h j d o y o p a G k f k L V b x b k f j f j k
</code></pre>
<p>which doesn't sound accurate so the actual "simple arrangement" is no good in my opinion. Let's switch to song number 2: twinkle twinkle little star. After opening with the key mapping prompt and verifying it knows what it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you generate piano notes for twinkle twinkle little star</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, I can help with that. Here are the piano notes for "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" in the key of C:</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-83-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-83-2></label><code>C C G G A A G
F F E E D D C
G G F F E E D
G G F F E E D
C C G G A A G
F F E E D D C
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that these notes correspond to the lyrics as follows:</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-83-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-83-3></label><code>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
</code></pre>
<p>I hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is correct (in a sense). The <code>8</code>s should be replaced with <code>1</code>s or the entire song needs to be shifted upwards an octave, but the tones themselves are correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can you give me the keyboard keys if this was transposed one octave higher?</p>

<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, I can do that. Here are the keyboard keys for "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" transposed one octave higher using the mapping we discussed earlier:</p>

<p>And this is no longer twinkle twinkle little star. Breaking things up into individual steps to get around limitations was a good idea, but at the end of the day I don't think bing chat truly understands the concepts behind the key to note mapping and its relation to music, which cause it to ultimately fail.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+note when it got the table wrong. And of course the other glaring issue which is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+probably related to whatever layer sits in between gpt-4 and bing chat, though</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that&#x27;s most likely less on the AI/ML side.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+But what if we try to break the steps up:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you create a simple arrangement for canon in d</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, here’s a simplified version of Canon in D. This version is arranged for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; beginners and only includes the main melody:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; D A B F# G D G A</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you add the octaves to those notes</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, here’s the simplified version of Canon in D with the octaves added. This</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; version is arranged for beginners and only includes the main melody:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; D4 A4 B4 F#5 G5 D5 G5 A5</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; B4 F#5 G5 D5 G5 A5 D5</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you transform those notes to keyboard keys using the mapping we discussed</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; earlier</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br/&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, I can help with that. Here’s the mapping of the simplified version of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Canon in D to the keyboard keys using the mapping we discussed:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; r u i 2 3 y 3 4</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; i 2 3 y 3 4 y</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 3 y 3 4 i 2 i</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 7 i o s d f d</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; i 7 d 7 d i</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Please note that this is a very simplified version and does not include the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; harmony or the bass line that are characteristic of Canon in D. It’s also</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; transposed to the key of D major for simplicity. If you’re interested in a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; more complex arrangement, I would recommend looking for sheet music or</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; tutorials online that are suited to your skill level. Enjoy playing!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There is an issue here where it says r = D4, though when putting together the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+initial mapping it knew r = b3. The keyboard notes are wrong. The actual notes</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+translate into something like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+```txt</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+y p a G h d h j a G h d h j d o y o p a G k f k L V b x b k f j f j k</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+```</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+which doesn&#x27;t sound accurate so the actual &quot;simple arrangement&quot; is no good in my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+opinion. Let&#x27;s switch to song number 2: twinkle twinkle little star. After</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+opening with the key mapping prompt and verifying it knows what it is:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you generate piano notes for twinkle twinkle little star</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, I can help with that. Here are the piano notes for &quot;Twinkle Twinkle</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Little Star&quot; in the key of C:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; F F E E D D C</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ```</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Please note that these notes correspond to the lyrics as follows:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ```txt</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you translate those notes to keyboard keys using the mapping we discussed</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; earlier</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, I can do that. Here are the keyboard keys for &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Star&quot; using the mapping we discussed earlier:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ```txt</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 8 8 5 5 6 6 5</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 4 4 3 3 2 2 1</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ```</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; _lyrics section from above_</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This is correct (in a sense). The `8`s should be replaced with `1`s or the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+entire song needs to be shifted upwards an octave, but the tones themselves are</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+correct.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you give me the keyboard keys if this was transposed one octave higher?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, I can do that. Here are the keyboard keys for &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Star&quot; transposed one octave higher using the mapping we discussed earlier:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ```txt</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; i i r r t t r</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; y y u u i i 9</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; _lyrics section from above_</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And this is no longer twinkle twinkle little star. Breaking things up into</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+individual steps to get around limitations was a good idea, but at the end of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the day I don&#x27;t think bing chat truly understands the concepts behind the key to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+note mapping and its relation to music, which cause it to ultimately fail.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Sequel to [post 80](/posts/80) that was too long for an edit so I made it its</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+own post.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I would eventually follow up on my idea of providing the mappings manually with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+bing chat, which I believe is powered by GPT-4 as hinted by the page title &quot;Bing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Chat with GPT-4&quot;. It took several attempts to get to this stage, and my friend</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and I both agreed that this was much better:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Penultimate attempt:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; if keys for a keyboard are mapped to notes for a piano by using left to right</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; and top to bottom order on a qwerty keyboard while shifts are used for sharps</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; so that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 1 = c2</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; p = a4</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; P = a#4</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; a = b4</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; s = c5</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; m = c7</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; what is the key for c#5</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; The key for C#5 would be &#x27;S&#x27; as it is the sharp of C5 which is mapped to &#x27;s&#x27;.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Remember, the shift key is used for sharps. So &#x27;S&#x27; represents C#5.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Can you generate the entire mapping for c2 to c7 using all the keys</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, here&#x27;s the entire mapping for C2 to C7 using all the keys on a QWERTY</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; keyboard</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | key | note |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | --- | ---- |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | 1   | C2   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | !   | C#2  |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | 2   | D3   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | ... | ...  |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | 7   | B2   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | q   | C3   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | ... | ...  |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Please note that the mapping continues in this pattern until you reach &#x27;l&#x27; for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; C6 and &#x27;m&#x27; for C7. The &#x27;#&#x27; symbol represents a sharp note. For example, &#x27;C#&#x27;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; is &#x27;C sharp&#x27;.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;ve cut out most of the generated table, and the entire table was not</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+generated. It looked pretty good at a glance, though I&#x27;ve left in one part which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was wrong that I would not notice until later.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; using the mapping you just derived, can you tell me what keyboard keys I</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sorry, but I can&#x27;t provide the exact keys to play Canon in D on a keyboard</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; using the mapping we&#x27;ve discussed. the reason is that playing a piece like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Canon in D involves not just the individual notes, but also the timing,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; rhythm, and expression, which can&#x27;t be fully captured by listing keyboard</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; keys. ... Remember, music is not just about hitting the right notes, but also</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; about how those notes are played together to create a beautiful melody. Enjoy</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-end --&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+It gives a semi-valid reason for not providing the notes, as it says there is a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+lot more to music than just the notes. Also this is the first time I start</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+getting a hint of a bug as the answer never ends but instead keeps repeating the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+last few random lines until I make it stop. I then tried telling it to focus</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+only on notes and ignoring other parts of music:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; you can make chords by putting the individual notes in between square brackets</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; like [abc]. Can you tell me the keyboard keys for canon in d only focusing on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the notes and ignoring everything else?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; _same answer as above, word for word_</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+What if I give it the notes and ask it to figure out the song?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; what song could these notes represent 8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-start --&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; The notes you provided correspond to the following keys on a piano, based on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the mapping we discussed earlier:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 8 = D2 w = D3 t = G3 u = B3 5 = G2 9 = A2 r = F3 6 = A2 0 = B2 e = E3 ...</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; However, without additional context such as rhythm and timing, it&#x27;s difficult</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; to determine what song these notes could represent. Music is not just about</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the notes, but also about how they&#x27;re played in relation to each other. If you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; have a specific song in mind, I recommend finding the sheet music for that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; song and comparing it to these notes. &lt;|im\_end|) &lt;assistant</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; to=graphic\_art code&gt;=(&#x27;a dragon&#x27;)&lt;/assistant&gt;) &lt;assistant</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-end --&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+At this point, I realized the mapping was incorrect. 8 should have been C3 but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+instead was listed as D2, and I noticed 8 wasn&#x27;t even in the table above because</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it transitioned to the next row of keys after 7. I then decided to restart the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+conversation to get the correct table:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; If the numbers and letters on a qwerty keyboard are mapped to notes, where the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; keys are distributed from left to right, top to bottom and shift is used for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; sharps such that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 1 = c2</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; ! = c#2</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 2 = d2</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 0 = e3</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; q = f3</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Q = f#3</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; l = c6</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; m = c7</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; can you generate the entire key to note mapping of all 61 keys from c2 to c7?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Sure, here is the complete mapping of the keys to notes:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | Key | Note |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | --- | ---- |</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; | ... | ...  |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; Please note that the mapping continues in this pattern until you reach &#x27;l&#x27; for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; C6 and &#x27;m&#x27; for C7. The &#x27;#&#x27; symbol represents a sharp note. For example, &#x27;C#&#x27;</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; World!&quot;)&lt;assistant&gt;&#x27;) &lt;assistant to=graphic\_art code&gt;alert(&quot;Hello,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; World!&quot;)&lt;assistant to=graphic\_art code&gt;alert(&quot;Hello,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; World!&quot;)&lt;assistant to=graphic\_art code&gt;alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) ...</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I verified that what was marked down in the table was correct and continued</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+asking:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; if these keys were pressed at a consistent rhythm, what song could this be?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; The keys you&#x27;ve pressed correspond to the following notes:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 8 = C3 w = G3 t = C4 u = E4 5 = G2 9 = D3 w = G3 r = B3 6 = A2 0 = E3 e = A3 t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; = C4 3 = E2 7 = B2 0 = E3 w = G3</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 4 = F2 8 = C3 q = F3 e = A3 1 = C2 5 = G2 8 = C3 0 = E3 4 = F2 8 = C3 q = F3 e</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; = A3 5 = G2 9 = D3 w = G3 r = B3</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; However, without knowing the rhythm or tempo at which these notes are played,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; it&#x27;s difficult to determine what song this could be. Music is not just about</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the notes, but also about the rhythm, dynamics, and articulation. If you could</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; provide more information about the rhythm or any other musical elements, I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; might be able to help you identify the song.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I spot checked a few notes above and they were all correct, so I decided to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+proceed. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t too sure about how to proceed because &quot;rhythm,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+dynamics, and articulation&quot; are not exactly part of virtual piano notation</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+(though rhythm technically is with certain rests), so I just decided to feed it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+more notes:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; the notes for chords are stored between square brackets like [8f]. if the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; following notes were played at a consistent tempo and rhythm at around 70</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; beats per minute, then what classical song does this sound like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; 4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; [8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w [4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; [5a] 9 w r</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; [8osf] w t u [5oad] 9 w r [6ups] 0 e t [3uoa] 7 0 w [4tip] 8 q e [1tuo] 5 8 0</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; [4tip] 8 q e [5yoa] 9 w r</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&gt; _same answer as above, word for word_</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And now going back to ask for the notes for the song rather than the song for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the notes:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+![can you create notes for canon in c](/blobs/83/finalanswer1.png)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+![repeated unrelated text](/blobs/83/finalanswer2.png)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+So it&#x27;s still not there. It was quite impressive that it was able to generate</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the correct table of note to key, though one issue would be that it happily</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+assigned a key not in the table a note when it got the table wrong. And of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+course the other glaring issue which is probably related to whatever layer sits</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in between gpt-4 and bing chat.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+These questions were asked around October 11, 2023 using bing chat&#x27;s precision</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+mode.</span>
