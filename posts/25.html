<p>Recently, I added another rule for markdown conversion and a bit of css to allow simple codeblock expansion/contraction like for the one below (assuming it takes up more than 50% of the view height)</p>

<p>When I do something like this, I usually go back and look through my previous posts to double check the output - but only long after having the updated site built. As I read through them, I notice a lot of small mistakes like missing words, misspellings, and code that doesn't work due to typos. To other readers (if any), could imply poor English/coding skills.</p>
<p>To be frank, I am not aiming for perfect posts, but rather posts that are all streams of thought where I type as I think and submit when finished with no other checks or extra work.</p>
<p>I want to keep the posts in their "raw" form, but decided to create this post to correct a few things. Also it just so happens this is the 25th entry, so I guess I will just do this every 25 entries to cover the previous 24. Naturally, I won't be able to catch everything with a single pass, but I guess this is better than nothing.</p>
<p>This will be the only time there is some kind of intro for these posts, although I may link back to this post for future ones for the explanation.</p>
