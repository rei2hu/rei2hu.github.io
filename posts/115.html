Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=on-dreaming>on dreaming</h1>
<p>Dreaming. I don't do it much, or at least I don't remember it when I wake up, but last night I had a very calming experience.</p>
<p>I won't bother with the details but it ended/I woke up at a peaceful moment and felt extremely relaxed.</p>
<p>Considering what I've been going through over the past few weeks, it was a much needed reprieve; I literally thanked my mind for the dream when I awoke. It was so impactful that I decided to write it down.</p>
<p>I considered extending this post by talking about things like lucid dreaming or other sleep practices (none of which I do), but in the end I decided to keep this short and sweet.</p>
