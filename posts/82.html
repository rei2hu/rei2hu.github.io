<h1 id=asking-dall-e-3-to-generate-sheet-music>asking dall-e 3 to generate sheet music</h1>
<p>Microsoft recently provided free access to DALL-E 3 through Bing's new Image Creator feature. <a href=/posts/80>Previously</a> we looked at chatGPT's attempt to generate virtual piano music. I decided to see if I could get a picture of sheet music from it.</p>
<p>So I gave it the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sheet music for canon in c using virtual piano's musical notation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It generated 4 images; let's take a look at them.</p>
<p><img alt="piano and town" src=/blobs/82/canonc1.png></p>
<p>The only relevant thing in this image is the piano. However, the keys of the piano are inaccurate as the black keys should be in groups of 2 then 3. I don't know how it decided to generate the rest of the picture from the prompt but it is what it is. And it looks nice.</p>
<p><img alt="piano surrounded by tendrils of music" src=/blobs/82/canonc2.png>
<img alt="another piano surrounded by tendrils of music" src=/blobs/82/canonc4.png></p>
<p>Here we have a piano and what looks like lines of music. However a closer look and we will see that most of these only look like notes - there are various imperfections that make them look wrong, even simple things like the note heads being only somewhat round. It's still a nice image to look at and I love how one of the tendrils floating upwards is made of piano keys.</p>
<p>The notes in the other image are even worse, unfortunately.</p>
<p><img alt="a river in a city with piano keys in the foreground" src=/blobs/82/canonc3.png></p>
<p>Here we have another town, dare I call it AI London, with inaccurate piano keys in the foreground. One interesting thing I'll note here is the clock faces which are not actually clock faces, or at least not the kind I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if DALLE-3 didn't understand the concept of sheet music, or if my initial prompt had too much cruft around it to generate an image of it, so I tried something more straightforward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sheet music for twinkle twinkle little star for violin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it generated another 4 images.</p>
<p><img alt="four ai generated images that each show measures and a
violin" src=/blobs/82/twinklesheet.png></p>
<p>On the top left picture, there is a picture of sheet music on a bed, but the contents of the sheet are messed up. In fact, in all the pictures, like before the notes do not look like notes; we can also see that the treble cleft is messed up a couple of times, though the fact that it uses a treble cleft which is what appears in violin sheet music is amazing - unless I ask it about something like cello music, which uses bass cleft, and it continues to draw trebles. The lines are actually lined up in the images, so it looks more like sheet music in that sense, too. There is also the attempt to include some musical terms and symbols outside the notes though most of it is incoherent.</p>
<p>This is all pretty cool except none of these notes are for twinkle twinkle little star. The bottom right image's violin also seems to be missing a chin rest, though that's not too uncommon as I've seen people use cloths instead. The top right musician is also holding the violin/viola reversed - the common way to play a violin is to hold the bow in the right hand and the violin neck in the left, though there is the existence of left-handed violins (naming is based on the bow hand) so it's not incorrect.</p>
<p>I ended up thinking perhaps musical notation was too tough to generate and tried to generate text instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the first page of a mystery horror novel</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="four ai generated images of a book opened to the first page with the text the
hillwood manor" src=/blobs/82/horrorbook.png></p>
<p>It was hoping for a page filled with text, but it instead gave what I would expect from a book cover printed on the first page of the book. All of the books seem to be called the Hillwood Manor (with varying degrees of spelling) and any attempt of text outside of "it was a dark and stormy night" is illegible, which can only be seen in the top right image. I guess it's not that good at text either? It is interesting that all of these books have the same content; I do not know if this is because they were generated in the same batch or for some other reason.</p>
<p>At least all of the hands are spot on as funny hands/appendages was previously an issue for image generationâ€¦ Actually I'm not too sure about the top right hand; it looks correct but is holding the book in a very weird way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the service is severely overloaded or bugged, as I have several prompts that have been processing for a few hours while re-submissions of those prompts have completed. The pending generations have locked me out from submitting any further prompts so I cannot test any further for now.</p>
<p>But I maintain my opinion; generative AI is bad at precision details. Music notes will be core to my evaluation criteria from now on for general intelligence - it's like text for sounds.</p>
