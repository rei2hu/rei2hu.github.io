<p>Alternative title: this writer only bitches when things go wrong.</p>
<p>Recently, I've been thinking of experiences I can share about working as an software engineer. I couldn't come up with anything good and decided to take a look back at what I've written so far. I'd categorize my posts into 3 different categories: random experiments, random life blurbs, and work musings. I wanted to write about professional software engineering so I took a closer look at my work musings.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, most (if not all) of these posts are kind of negative in various ways. Is it the case that I've never had a <strong>good</strong> experience working before? Definitely not, so what's up? I thought back to some of my better projects, and realize I don't have much to actually say about them - kind of like another day at the (virtual) office. On the other hand, if you're fighting a fire, you come away with various lessons learned which make the experience memorable.</p>
<p>One of my most impressive, smooth-sailing projects revolved around creating/training an ml model (<em>cough</em> basic statistics <em>cough</em>) with a few data scientists, then setting up backend/frontend things to let users interact with it. The project went well, we finished things ahead of deadline, released, and users were happy. I think I'm supposed to also have some lessons learned in this case - namely, what did we do right so that things went so smoothly. Unfortunately the truth is we did nothing remotely revolutionary in terms of planning or getting work done so I really can't point anything out - we just worked as usual and things… worked. Also as a lower level individual contributor I don't really make calls on overarching organization details usually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, once I was stuck into the lead spot for a project where we had to build an integration with one of our vendors. This one wasn't very dumpster fire either, but there was 1 main road bump that stalled the project - the vendor was taking forever to provision us with test credentials for their product. And really it just required me to tell the pm the issue and she leaned on the vendor until they did their job. Lesson learned: escalate to the right people that can get the job done? Except that's what I did from the start, so not really a lesson learned.</p>
<p>On the third hand, there are some true dumpster fires that I look back on and pull solid lessons from. Which is probably every other work related post you'll find here so far… although I think I never really explicitly state what the takeaways are.</p>
<p>I think this is a result of my upbringing - I just don't get very excited about the good stuff. And I think conflict is more interesting anyways, but I'd like to emphasize that I mean it's more interesting for reading/writing - in work I'd prefer not to stir up unnecessary conflict for the sake of interesting stories. Perhaps these values are reflected in our society in various ways today, but that's too philosophical for this post.</p>
<p>Although I did just have a pretty funny experience that I have a takeaway from that happened literally 5-10 minutes ago involving a code review with a feature but also a ton of random refactoring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>person: you accepted with no comments or complaints on my pr?</p>
<p>me: yep looks good, I just wish it wasn't 99% refactoring</p>
<p><em>10 minutes later</em></p>
<p>person: @me hey I found an issue in my pr, can you re-review it</p>
<p>me: fffffffffffff (I let a bug through)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I started glazing over because most things were space/variable changes. I already did know that it's best to separate changes with different purposes into different pull requests. I guess I just don't push back hard enough on small things, then again <code>person</code> is a sr engineer so maybe it's a hierarchical thing that I unconsciously follow, as I remember being pretty strict with some intern code a few months back…</p>
<p>Yeah it's not unconscious because I'm aware that I do this - assume more senior people know what they're doing unless otherwise shown. The question is does sticking a bunch of refactoring to 20x the amount of changes in a pull request really worth lowering my evaluation of someone's technical skills? Maybe and maybe not, but that could be the bias speaking.</p>
<p>Ok, revolution time, let's get rid of the hierarchy I guess.</p>
