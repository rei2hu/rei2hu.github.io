<blockquote>
<p>Au contraire, I have the motivation this year. In fact, I wrote this a few weeks before December 1st and agonized over trying to find things to write about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year… it's a week late. Writing this was on my mind for the past week but I've been busy enough that I was willing to delay the less important things for more time.</p>
<h2 id=recap>recap</h2>
<h3 id=remote-work>remote work</h3>
<p>Still remote and in the same job. It still has the classic design/pm bottlenecks, though in this case the issue is specifically with design.</p>
<p>To be honest, I have been casually looking for a new job since the second half of the year, but nothing much has come out of it. I had some interviews and neither went well from my perspective - I'm just not a good interviewee (and I didn't think the process was carried out well, but irrelevant). I plan to put more effort into applying next year.</p>
<p>I'm definitely trying to avoid a standard B2B software engineering position because… yeah. I'm just more technical at heart, and don't want to have several layers of indirection between myself and the user (if there are users).</p>
<h3 id=school>school</h3>
<p>So I have been taking two to three courses a semester for the past few semesters, and in the ideal scenario, I'll have finished the program by next summer. Actually, I've already finished all the computer science requirements and just have math courses left (what is actual computer science but math on computers?)</p>
<p>In general, I've been able to complete most of the work on time but this semester has been quite difficult. One of the classes covers relatively new topics (for me) and is hard and the other is just extremely unorganized. Finals are in a week and I've just lowered my grade expectations to be B's. Not saying that I expect a B, but rather that I would accept a B (which only requires receiving 50s and 40s on the final exams, curves withstanding).</p>
<p>It's a good thing that I did not actually have the chance to TA this semester or I might have fallen over. A little ironic because I specifically remember writing about how some people in my classes would publicly complain about their workloads when it was self-inflicted during my first year and hear I am, doing something similar. But not complaining as hard, or as publicly, I hope.</p>
<p>Small update on grades, I was able to pull an A and A- in my classes somehow. No A+s this semester but that's fine… though I have reason to believe the A- should be a flat A because I can see the final percentage and can compare that with the actual cutoff ranges provided by the professor at the end. I'm tired of dealing with that class and don't really care even if it does mess with the 4.0 gpa. 50% of that class' grading was a mess and I'm just glad it's over.</p>
<p>Actually, I just did a manual calculation of the grades and the A- is correct. I guess the weighting is off somehow in the individual grade report software.</p>
<h3 id=blog-stats>blog stats</h3>
<p>I've written 26 times this year, which is a lot more than I thought, and I think I was able to write about some nice technical topics (with hopefully more in the pipeline); some of it related to topics covered in graduate school. I plan to write a few more posts related to it, or at least have a retrospective on what I thought about the specific courses I took.</p>
<h3 id=last-years-goal-summary>last year's goal summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Maintain my current lifestyle quality - technically yes, but with graduate school I've been busier than normal with this semester having a noticeable impact on qol.</li>
<li>Do well in school - yes, with straight A's so far but that might not last after this semester ends.</li>
<li>Learn new recipes/improved cooking techniques - I've been too busy to experiment in cooking.</li>
<li>Drink water - I think this has been good, but I did notice I stopped doing as well recently (probably because of school)</li>
<li>Sleep on time - Same thing as water, good until recently.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=settling-in>settling in</h3>
<p>Two years ago I considered moving and/or buying a house. One year ago I decided not to. This year, that idea is back on the market. In fact, it's also related to my new job search. I'm looking for a job that will cover relocation and that I can have for the rest of my career, ideally. If you put together all of these things… well, there are some places I have in mind. Unfortunately I put in an application months ago and haven't heard anything since. The job market is kind of tough.</p>
<p>I'm keeping things short this year because my mind is filled with things unrelated to what I prefer to write about.</p>
<h3 id=new-goals>new goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Graduate<ul>
<li>Pretty obvious, and should happen soon.</li></ul></li>
<li>Get a new job, new place<ul>
<li>Straightforward</li></ul></li>
