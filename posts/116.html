<p>This year… well it's a week late. Writing this was on my mind for the past week but I've been busy enough that I was willing to delay the less important things for more time.</p>
<h2 id=recap>recap</h2>
<h3 id=remote-work>remote work</h3>
<p>Still remote and in the same job. It still has the classic design/pm bottlenecks, though in this case the issue is specifically with design.</p>
<p>To be honest, I have been casually looking for a new job since the second half of the year, but nothing much has come out of it. I had some interviews and neither went well from my perspective - I'm just not a good interviewee (and I didn't think the process was carried out well, but irrelevant). I plan to put more effort into applying next year.</p>
<p>I'm definitely trying to avoid a standard B2B software engineering position because… yeah. I'm just more technical at heart.</p>
<h3 id=school>school</h3>
<p>So I have been taking two or three courses a semester for the past few semesters, and in the ideal scenario, I'll have finished the program by next summer. Actually, I've already finished all the computer science requirements and just have math courses left.</p>
<p>In general, I've been able to complete most of the work on time but this semester has been quite difficult. One of the classes covers relatively new topics (for me) and is hard and the other is just extremely unorganized. Finals are in a week and I've just lowered my grade expectations to be B's. Not saying that I expect a B, but rather that I would accept a B (which only requires receiving 60s on the final exams, curves withstanding).</p>
<h3 id=blog-stats>blog stats</h3>
<p>I've written 26 times this year, which is a lot more than I thought, and I think I was able to write about some nice technical topics (with hopefully more in the pipeline); some of it related to topics covered in graduate school. I plan to write a few more posts related to it, or at least have a retrospective on what I thought about the specific courses I took.</p>
<h3 id=last-years-goal-summary>last year's goal summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Maintain my current lifestyle quality - technically yes, but with graduate school I've been busier than normal with this semester having a noticeable impact on qol.</li>
<li>Do well in school - yes, with straight A's so far but that might not last after this semester ends.</li>
<li>Learn new recipes/improved cooking techniques - I've been too busy to experiment in cooking.</li>
<li>Drink water - I think this has been good, but I did notice I stopped doing as well recently (probably because of school)</li>
<li>Sleep on time - Same thing as water, good until recently.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=settling-in>settling in</h3>
<p>Two years ago I considered moving and/or buying a house. That idea is back on the market this year. In fact, it's also related to my new job search. I'm looking for a job I can have for the rest of my career, ideally. If you put together all of these things… well there are some places I have in mind.</p>
<p>I'm keeping things short this year because my mind is filled with things unrelated to what I prefer to write about.</p>
<h3 id=new-goals>new goals</h3>
