Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=encounter-with-formal-math>encounter with formal math</h1>
<p>I've been going back and forth between writing this and not, because my opinion is constantly changing in real time (and I can also use that as an excuse to avoid writing).</p>
<p>I haven't done much formal math since my undergraduate courses several years ago where I minored in math, and I'm currently doing a masters program. I'm on my last couple of semesters and opted for some heavier math courses as opposed to computer science courses for the challenge and learning experienceâ€¦ So I picked advanced Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>I mean, the computer science courses did have various proofs for things like optimal checkpointing considering things like failure rate/backup time or time for full message dissemination (with high probability), but none of them were really rigorous.</p>
<p>We're about four to five weeks into the course and I think I've gotten a better handle on things, but the first two weeks were extremely intense and was basically a full review of an undergraduate level statistics class followed by a review of an undergraduate level Bayesian statistics class. Mind you, the current university I'm attending is not the same as my undergraduate one so some of the topics were actually entirely new while others were not new but still hard to initially grasp.</p>
<p>It was so bad I was actually a week behind in terms of work up to the third week, whereas previously I would be on schedule or even one week ahead. The two largest hurdles was understanding the vocabulary/notation and figuring out jumps in reasoning being made between various equations. I spent extra time on weekdays going over things so I could understand them, when for all my previous classes I did not have to do that.</p>
<p>I think another thing that might be useful is that I now try to reason through the content ahead of time, before lectures. It's easy to follow the content when it's being presented, but I don't think I was actually getting it - I would say this is the trap I fell into for the first few weeks. I also do believe things have become easier because we're switched focus from the math heavy concepts like derivations and other things (which are still there, but not as heavily emphasized) to using software to use the covered techniques to approximate, simulate, or analyze various real world situations.</p>
