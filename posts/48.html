Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX and TikZ diagrams, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<p>I was strictly in the "if you can do it in one query then do it in one query" camp for a while, but when I couldn't get a pretty complex query with several joins and aggregate functions to perform, I started doubting that saying.</p>
<p>After asking for some thoughts and reading some texts, my opinion has now turned into the classic "it depends".</p>
<p>Also another thing I've learned is that you can improve aggregate functions by being more specific sometimes. <code>count(table.primary_field)</code> vs <code>count(*)</code> can greatly improve performance when joins are involved because it could lower table widths. I think I remember hearing about being more specific in aggregate functions in university but forgot about it.</p>
<h2 id=kind-of-an-update>kind of an update</h2>
<p>I came across some articles mentioning that <code>count(*)</code> is as fast as or even faster than its equivalents as it's a special case. I remembered that I wrote something contradicting and looked back here to check. I wish I had recorded more details about the specific queries I was looking at. My guess is that everyone is talking about the actual execution of count, while I'm trying to discuss how the <code>x</code> in <code>count(x)</code> can change the width of the rows in the returned tables after a join, resulting in less memory io and a faster query?</p>
