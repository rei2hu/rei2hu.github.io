<h1 id=framework-gaming-and-egpus>framework gaming and egpus</h1>
<p>So last year (new year's joke), I successfully put together an egpu (external graphics processing unit) and hooked it up to my framework laptop. So far, it has satisfied all of my graphics needs and it seems like the bottleneck is now the cpu.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about actual gaming with the egpu, I'd like to discuss a bunch of random things that came up when purchasing, building, and using it. I'm a novice when it comes to hardware so a lot of this may be uninteresting.</p>
<p>I decided to buy the parts late November last year, and ordered a dock, psu (power supply unit), and a gpu. This was kind of an impulse buy, as there were good black friday deals and I did not do too much research on egpus beforehand; in fact I wasn't sure that the pieces I bought would be compatible with each other - the main thing I looked at was that the psu could power the gpu.</p>
<p>I ordered the dock separately from the psu and gpu because it seemed to only be available from aliexpress, an exp gdc something something; that ended up arriving within 2 weeks or so. On the other hand, I received estimated dates for the psu and gpu around the same time - expected arrival late January.</p>
<p>This brought up an question that I discussed with some friends - is it reasonable to expect a package to be shipped and delivered within 2 weeks in the modern world? The general consensus was yes, and because the gpu/psu was expected to arrive two months after ordering, I ordered similar items from elsewhere and cancelled the original order. The reordered items arrived in late December.</p>
<p>While I was waiting for the items, I did more research on gpus. What I bought was a nvidia rtx 4060 i.e. the low end of the newest series of cards at the time. What I read online was that the 4060 is barely an upgrade compared to the 3060 which sports more vram, more cores, and more (a lot of other things). I came across this tidbit a few days before the gpu was going to arrive so I did not attempt to swap it out. It still performs better though, but it does seem weird that the newer generation would have less resources. Either way, I'm sure my needs are much less than what the cards can handle so hopefully I'll never hit the limits.</p>
<p>Putting together the egpu was actually pretty simple, but anytime I heard a weird cracking noise I was afraid that I just threw \$400 down the drain because I broke something. I don't have a case for the parts so it's freeform and does look quite wonky and lopsided but is overall stable.</p>
<p>Hooking it up was also very simple - plug it in, turn the laptop on, and install drivers. Everything works fine… kind of. So, framework laptops have hardware switches for its mic and cameras, which I typically keep off. For some reason, if they're off when the laptop starts (and the egpu is plugged in), I have no audio devices and toggling the switch won't fix anything. The simple workaround is to have the switch turned on when powering on the laptop, then I can use it freely afterwards. I have no idea why this is happening.</p>
<p>I've also had my entire screen freeze a couple of times which resulted in having to hold the power button to restart the laptop…</p>
<p>But overall it's very convenient; want to use your laptop normally? Unplug from the egpu. Want to game or do graphics intensive work? Plug into the egpu. As long as you powered on your laptop with the egpu plugged in, you can plug and unplug it without any worry.</p>
