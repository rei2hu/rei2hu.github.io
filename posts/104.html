Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<h1 id=thoughts-on-space-related-data-structures>thoughts on space related data structures</h1>
<p>Yesterday, a discussion I was in somehow turned towards quadtrees and their use. Eventually, someone mentioned that spatial hashes and BVH (bounding volume hierarchies) were more common now.</p>
<p>The first random insight I had was related to trees. Why are quadtrees used for 2d applications while octotrees are used for 3d? Visually, you can see that the spaces break down recursively into 4 or 8 subspaces, but why is that?</p>
<p>This is because of the number of axes - 2 and 3; the data structures are basically doing a binary partition of each axis in space, which means trees will have $2^d$ children when used to represent areas with $d$ dimensions.</p>
<p>In fact, this is applicable to 1d too if you look at something like a sorted list, where we use binary trees (or at least could use binary trees conceptually).</p>
<p>And for higher dimensions? Well, I guess it means you can somehow partition it into 16 spaces and use a 16 tree but that's probably hard to visualize (at least I can't).</p>
<p>While I'm not familiar with BVH, a quick look over the description makes it sound like a similar idea but with arbitrary partitions instead of binary ones. Spatial hashing does something similar; picking a hash based on what partition(s) objects fall into, though the partitions at every level can also be customized in this case.</p>
<p>All of the ideas are very similar - grouping objects in space depending on their proximity to one another, and using the grouping to be able to figure out proximity later on.</p>
