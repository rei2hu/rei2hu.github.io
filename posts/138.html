<h2 id=recap>recap</h2>
<h3 id=job-search>job search</h3>
<p>I think I've been attempting to get a new job for over a year now, and that hasn't been a successful endeavor to say the least. I think there is a mix of factors at play here, the largest of which is a <em>dubious job market for software engineers</em>. Other factors that affect things are probably my general lack of skill at job applications, my strict requirements about how my position is related to things that I think are "bad", and my inability to apply for jobs that I may be unqualified for.</p>
<p>To provide a little more detail on the latter points, though they may have already come up in previous posts, I'll say that my response rate for a job application has almost always been in the single to low double digit percents - and that's with taking the time to write cover letters and customize resumes. In fact, I actually only got my first job after several hundred applications during a "hot" job market, though my second job came pretty fast. Because the application process is opaque, it's hard to know how to do better.</p>
<p>What about job requirements related to "bad" things? What do I consider "bad"? To step back a bit, I do want to do more computer sciencey software engineering and did a Master's degree to facilitate this goal. However, in my observation, a lot of deep tech work falls under the research arms of big tech companies, and I think big tech is "bad", which means I would never take a job with some of the largest software engineering companies (this does not mean I wouldn't take an interview (for practice, I swear!) though). The line is kind of blurry though, because there are times where I considered working for something like a non-profit funded by social media/ad money, or considered working for the government which is currently… At the end of the day, it's up to me though I try to keep true to myself.</p>
<p>As for applying for jobs that I think I'm unqualified for, I think it's pretty sad funny when jobs have a list of requirements but then say things like "If you think you're underqualified apply anyways especially if you're from an underrepresented group". I personally only would attempt applying if I had all the main requirements and several nice to haves that come with a typical application.</p>
<p>All in all, no new job. But with the cooling market for software engineers (and maybe others), then it might be better for me to hunker down and hold on to my current position. I may be delusional but I think that I both outperform and am cheaper than my peers.</p>
<h3 id=retirement>retirement???</h3>
<p>I wasn't sure if I wanted to write this as it may come across as a brag. After several years of average tech jobs with neutral to positive societal impact, I have obtained over 7 figures of wealth through making above average money, saving aggressively, and investing slightly less aggressively. Unfortunately, I do not think it is enough to retire. But maybe it is enough to quit tech; I really could not say. However, we also may be in an AI bubble right now so if that pops then I could lose some of that - hopefully I'm not hit too hard because I don't have high exposure to AI related stocks.</p>
<p>While the previous section details me looking for another job, I would also not be adverse to exiting the tech industry because I think it's hard to find a fulfilling job and I'm not a big fan of the culture overall, which is ironic because I enjoyed and have been enjoying software engineering in non-corporate settings for almost two decades, and I am holding on for dear life after only a few years working professionally. It's not just that working professionally has some level of administrative work that comes with the job, but I take various issues with the process of making software professionally from inception to delivery. Obviously there are other industries where one doesn't have a fulfilling job AND also gets paid peanuts so I'm not really in a position to complain.</p>
<p>I do find it somewhat daunting to start another career path when I've already spent time and money on certifications (bachelor's, master's) for computer science, though there are other things I would be amicable towards doing. I do not mind starting again as a junior as I love to learn. And I mean that wholeheartedly and am not saying that as some selling point. I always imagined myself constantly taking classes and learning things if I was to ever retire… but I could just laze around and play video games. To be honest, there are a lot of things to learn depending on the game.</p>
<h3 id=blog-stats>blog stats</h3>
<p>I've written 12 times this year compared to last year's 26. I have missed one month, but in reality, one of the posts this year is filler that I made to convince myself I didn't miss 2 consecutive months, so make it two missed months. Even this post, which I would typically have written days ahead of December 1st, is being put together on December 1st - at least this technically guarantees that I won't have to write anything else for this year since this can count as my December post. I'll probably have at least the second part for my simplex posts by the end of this year, though.</p>
<p>I think the lack of writing stems from a couple issues which are the lack of motivation to start writing something, and the lack of things to write about. If I do have something to write, like the recent simplex method post, and I motivate myself enough to start writing, then I can definitely put the effort into doing so. However, I seem to be lacking motivation to start, which is why the second part is not coming along at all - even though I have ideas on what I want to put in it. Surely I'll have it ready this month though. Right?</p>
<h3 id=last-years-goal-summary>last year's goal summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Graduate - I graduated in Spring 2025. It was a good program and I wrote some thoughts about it in a <a href=/posts/130>previous post</a>.</li>
<li>Get a new job, new place - this did not happen. I think I'll be hunkering down at my current job for now. If I can keep up my savings rate then I should definitely have enough money to retire in at most a decade, then maybe I can get a job as a hobby at a new place.</li>
<li>Drink water - probably drinking less than I could be, so I'll make a note to improve that this year</li>
<li>Sleep on time - I think I sleep well outside of my turn in the on-call rotation. When it is my turn, I basically attempt to stay up constantly and only sleep in like 30 minute to 1 hour intervals. It's weird because our production environment isn't even volatile - I just don't want to miss a page and have it go to someone else when it's my responsibility to handle them.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=daily-weekly-yearly-routines>daily, weekly, yearly routines</h3>
<p>Do I even have anything I want to write about here? I think this section (as in the section after last year's goal summary) was supposed to be about looking forward, but, to be honest, I think I've settled into a normal routine of work, chores, relax. Maybe I could write a little about how a younger me would've expected something different with much higher expectations but nah. The current me thinks is content to be where I am now, and I think this is a mindset that one needs to slowly realize (if it's coming to fruition) to avoid a midlife crisis. Maybe not though, as reading the Wikipedia page on midlife crises shows that it could be something else.</p>
<p>Am I slated to this routine for the rest of my life? Maybe.</p>
<h3 id=new-goals>new goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Maintain the status quo - I say this, but I am still on the lookout for a new job. This could be some form of copium; didn't get a new job? I'm just maintaining the status quo!</li>
<li>Drink water (habitual)</li>
<li>Sleep on time (habitual)</li>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### job search</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I think I&#x27;ve been attempting to get a new job for over a year now, and that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+hasn&#x27;t been a successful endeavor to say the least. I think there is a mix of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+factors at play here, the largest of which is a _dubious job market for software</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+engineers_. Other factors that affect things are probably my general lack of</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+To provide a little more detail on the latter points, though they may have</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+already come up in previous posts, I&#x27;ll say that my response rate for a job</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+application has almost always been in the single to low double digit percents -</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Graduate - I graduated in Spring 2025. It was a good program and I wrote some</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   thoughts about it in a [previous post](/posts/130).</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Get a new job, new place - this did not happen. I think I&#x27;ll be hunkering</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   down at my current job for now. If I can keep up my savings rate then I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   should definitely have enough money to retire in at most a decade, then maybe</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   I can get a new job and new place.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Drink water - probably drinking less than I could be, so I&#x27;ll make a note to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   improve that this year</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+4. Sleep on time - I think I sleep well outside of my turn in the on-call</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   rotation. When it is my turn, I basically attempt to stay up constantly and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   only sleep in like 30 minute to 1 hour intervals. It&#x27;s weird because our</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   production environment isn&#x27;t even volatile - I just don&#x27;t want to miss a page</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+### daily, weekly, yearly routines</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Do I even have anything I want to write about here? I think this section (as in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the section after last year&#x27;s goal summary) was supposed to be about looking</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+forward, but, to be honest, I think I&#x27;ve settled into a normal routine of work,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+chores, relax. Maybe I could write a little about how a younger me would&#x27;ve</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+expected something different with much higher expectations but nah. The current</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+me thinks is content to be where I am now, and I think this is a mindset that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+one needs to slowly realize (if it&#x27;s coming to fruition) to avoid a midlife</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+crisis. Maybe not though, as reading the Wikipedia page on midlife crises shows</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that it could be something else.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### new goals</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Maintain the status quo - I say this, but I am still on the lookout for a new</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   job. This could be some form of copium; didn&#x27;t get a new job? I&#x27;m just</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   maintaining the status quo!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Drink water (habitual)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Sleep on time (habitual)</span>
