<h1 id=my-time-on-mmos>my time on mmos</h1>
<p>I've recently just stopped playing Guild Wars 2, which is the game I hinted at in my <a href=/posts/62>yearly reflection</a> and realized this is probably the first couple of months where I haven't spent some time on massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) - in fact, I'm not sure I will pick one up in the future now that my <a href=/posts/63>current laptop</a> has extremely low specs. Because of this, I've decided to look back and review various aspects of MMOs that I regularly played, including things like how I got into them (I believe there's a common threat), how far into the endgame I was, my experiences and opinions, and other things I consider fun or interesting to know. We'll start with Guild Wars 2, as it was last, then go in an order that lets me distribute graphics evenly :).</p>
<h2 id=guild-wars-2>guild wars 2</h2>
<p>The interesting thing here is that I typically do not pay money for games. I got into Guild Wars 2 because I sent a friend a \$50 prepaid card for his birthday. He ended up spending around half of it on Guild Wars 2, and wanted me to also play it so I, like the cheap person I am, used the other half of the money on the card to purchase my own copy with his blessing.</p>
<p>For the next two or so months, we hit max level (not really an achievement in this game) and played through both the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire expansions. After this, he kind of dropped off and I was left to play by myself.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, I would end up getting full legendary equipment for medium armor classes, obtain basically maxed out characters for each profession (professions are classes like thief warrior etc), have around 16000 achievement points, and play through most aspects of the game, including the newest expansion… which I bought.</p>
<p>Like most MMOs, initial progression is kind of boring - many activities give experience quickly get repetitive. When I quit, I understood that they were testing out new experience curves to help with this. Once you hit max level, there are suddenly many more things you can do - Guild Wars 2 touts horizontal progression, and this is where it kind of comes in. It's typically straightforward to get "good" gear (just ~5% worse than the best gear!), and changing your characters' combat skills is free, which means not much time is spent on prepping a max-level character. In fact, gearing is irrelevant if you are a PvPer, as equipment there is standardized (there is another kind of PvP game mode where gear does matter, though).</p>
<p>Gear is simple in the game; a few combinations of stats exist, and any piece of gear can have that combination. The three (two) highest tiers of gear are exotic, ascended, and legendary. Exotic gear with most stat combinations can be acquired easily, ascended can be acquired somewhat easily and offers a minuscule boost, and legendary takes forever to acquire and is only better than ascended in quality of life features.</p>
<p>Once you've picked up a semi-meta build, you may continue to the main PvE activities, which are going to be achievement hunting, doing events, or raiding.</p>
<p>Achievement hunting is diverse and includes things like collecting items, completing jumping puzzles, or satisfying other criteria. Achievements can lead to better gear and other unique rewards and are usually straightforward, but perhaps tasking, to perform. I only had around 16k achievement points, where a maximum of 50k - 60k exist, but 16k is arguably quite respectable, and I would say 30k is like a longtime consistent player.</p>
<p>Doing events is probably an interesting one, as there are generic events that occur on timers around the world that are open to anyone. Some of them require a very tiny amount of teamwork and skill - in some cases, too much. Many of the existing large events are set at an elementary level where minimum effort is required to receive rewards, which seems to have had a certain effect on the general player base. Other events, like the Dragon's End meta, that initially had a high failure rate, were slowly nerfed to fit the average player. The events are fun at first, but the more difficult ones become annoying once you realize you cannot really control much in a group of 50 random players.</p>
<p>Raiding is the typical MMO type of raid. It uses the standard group composition of support/tank/damage dealers and has some unique mechanics to work around. There are also strikes, which are a kind of compressed raid with only one boss. There are also fractals, which some people would disagree as categorizing as raids, where party composition is free-er (typically all damage) and consists of several types of dungeons. All of these fights include challenge motes, which can make them more difficult for more rewards or achievements. Like all activities, these were interesting at first, but quickly grew boring and repetitive. The main issue around this is running with less experienced/more casual players who don't quantify the impact or learn mechanics that drag the group down. Guild Wars 2 allows addons and mods, like ArcDPS, which can be used to track damage among other stats. I also know they introduced a kind of beginner mode for raids to help things along.</p>
<p>As for PvP, there is structured Player versus Player (sPvP) and World Versus World (WvW). I will skip over sPvP.</p>
<p>WvW is where I spent the entire second half of my time. This is a server versus server game mode, hence world. The idea behind this game mode is to capture and hold various structures in maps, but not many care about that. The things people cared about were matchups, experience, and fights.</p>
<p>The matchup is slightly related to capturing and holding as that activity determines the score and, therefore, which servers will be fought in the next match - specific servers have specific types of players which may or may not be fun to play against. Experience is strictly to get rewards, and capturing/fighting is what nets experience. Holding kind of does; it is only relevant if there are enemies to defend against. Fights are probably the thing that most WvW players enjoy, as it consists of groups of 20-50+ players running at each other in a somewhat coordinated fashion - nothing beats smashing a group twice your size as usually numbers matter, but sometimes they don't - public groups have more people but a wider distribution of skill, private groups typically have higher quality players but fewer of them. Eventually, I got tired of this, though, and went on to do guild versus guild (GvG) which is the same thing, but where the sides consist of try-hard players who focus on fighting other try-hard players exclusively. It's probably the funnest game mode, as fights do have a few consistent themes but are more random and require a lot more coordination to do well in.</p>
<p>Here's a clip of casual GvG where I pull, then knock around a guildmate so he dies.</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/71/arcane.mp4></p>
<p>I'm not really listening to the commander, but getting a pick is sometimes actually better. This kind of single target gameplay is table stakes for GvG as it's extremely efficient… except it was a casual one and my troll gameplay caused a bit of drama as it turns out I was knocking around a server admin in other rounds (certain professions are better for targeting as they have less survivability). I have a full recording and more in the following youtube playlist: PLFcNSaFKsff(sx)dzOzjZbzVNa-Nj-uw(uno)ox(nein); replace the parenthesized text with the single digit number.</p>
<p>I did end up quitting because WvW was the only thing keeping me in, and I couldn't find a high skilled but casual guild that matched my taste. And my current guild did disband - though I'll partly attribute it to the toxic try-hard mentality that was introduced over the past few months.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize Guild Wars 2, I'd say that it's a good game with diverse content, the only grind is the one you set for yourself, and if you're looking to enjoy the entire game, find some proper people to play with; well, that's true for all MMOs, isn't it?</p>
<h2 id=gunbound>gunbound</h2>
<p>Casual cartoony game time!</p>
<p>I don't think I really played this game that much, but it did leave an impression on me - perhaps it had to do with math brain. The core gameplay involved firing projectiles at other players based on a picked angle/power and taking wind into account. Depending on what you picked, projectiles would also have interesting effects such as attracting nearby players to the impact area, or tunneling underground. It was an extremely fun game and I'm not sure why it shut down; maybe because the skill ceiling was kind of low - once you know how to aim then it's basically game over. Aimbots were kind of easy to implement, it's one of those scenarios where the hacks could be external to the game itself. Imagine inputting wind speed, distance, and height difference into a calculator and getting angle and power out; although this way doesn't exactly factor special mechanics in.</p>
<h2 id=adventure-quest>adventure quest</h2>
<h2 id=adventure-quest-worlds>adventure quest worlds</h2>
<h2 id=dragon-fable>dragon fable</h2>
<p>Like most of my early games, I think I was drawn to these 3 because of their graphics and simplicity. Top that off with a ton of content, it was quite good. The only downside would be that all of these had very little player interaction. Well, also I'll mention that after a certain point of playing these games, I just used trainers to bypass various barriers and explore more easily - it's interesting how simple making trainers for these games were. I feel like I was able to cover a solid amount of the content in these games, but there always seemed to be more.</p>
<h2 id=maplestory>maplestory</h2>
<p>Well, of course I had to write something about this game, didn't I? I honestly consider going back to it quite often, but I know it's changed a lot so this review will be extremely out of date.</p>
<p>I figure I played since 2005 because that's when PICs were introduced, and played up until… 2011? Based on what I remember of the game and what I'm reading of the patch notes, sometime between the MapleStory Legends and MapleStory Alliance Rising patches is when my first main account was banned. There's probably a year or two in there that I didn't play the game, then picked it up a bit after as I'm familiar with some things mentioned in the later patch notes. Looking at an <a href=/posts/18>older post</a> about the game, I claim 2014, so let's go with that.</p>
<p>Of course, as explained in the post mentioned above, my early time consisted of just walking around and exploring the world after luckily coming across a relatively large amount of mesos (money) to fund the exploration. Now that I'm looking closer at what I said in that post, I assume that the period of quitting was sometime between 2007 and 2008, as the trashmail year suggests my main account was created then - I do remember they offered new domains depending on the year so it may be after. I also remember the existence of Demethos. Either way, when I got back into the game, I started grinding.</p>
<p>I will use the following <a href=http://www.southperry.net/timeline.php>timeline</a> to mention anything I remember about these releases or events, and then comment on anything I think of in between.</p>
<h3 id=2005---cash-shop-opens>2005 - Cash Shop Opens</h3>
<p>I remember I used to sit in the Cash Shop for a long time just trying things out. And the music is fantastic and chill. I guess I was like a window shopper in that sense.</p>
<h3 id=2006---omega-sector>2006 - Omega Sector</h3>
<h3 id=2006---aqua-road>2006 - Aqua Road</h3>
<h3 id=2006---amoria>2006 - Amoria</h3>
<p>I remember the release of these areas as I immediately traveled to check them out. I'm not exactly sure how I got through Omega Sector and Aqua Road as a level 19 player, but perhaps it used to be scaled down. Also, the release of Amoria was amazing as it was probably one of the largest maps to date and very romantic to boot!</p>
<h3 id=2007---henesys-pqludi-maze-pq>2007 - Henesys PQ/Ludi Maze PQ</h3>
<h3 id=2007---prendergast-mansion-haunted-house>2007 - Prendergast Mansion (Haunted House)</h3>
<p>Henesys party quest (HPQ) was an interesting one, not because of the actual gameplay, but because it led to specialized roles to cheese the PQ. The PQ was completed after obtaining 10(?) rice cakes and any extras should be removed from your inventory after leaving the area, but this could be bypassed. This led to the creation of smugglers, who were able to "smuggle" rice cakes out of the area - leading to the ability to finish the PQ quickly. Another role was someone that could lure - The main task, depending a bunny that created rice cakes, and "lurers" would use Pico-Pico Hammers (weapons with minimum attack stats) to attack and lure enemies into a corner of the map. More wouldn't spawn until the current enemies were killed.</p>
<p>PQs overall were a fun activity, although a lot of them involved brute-forcing a code in their stages e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerning PQ - Have 3 people hang on 3 of the correct ropes out of 4.</li>
<li>KPQ - have 3 people stand on the correct 3 platforms out of 5.</li>
<li>Ludibrium PQ - guess the right box out of 3 15 times in a row. (fixed answer though)</li>
<li>LPQ - stand on the correct 5 boxes out of 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably more that I'm forgetting. I do know PQs were later greatly simplified. Talking about LPQ also reminds me of one of my favorite skills; Power Guard. It damages enemies when you get damaged and could be used to kill "unkillable" enemies or enemies of much higher levels, as long as you had the health to withstand their attacks. This led to many other things, too, like my favorite hack, which utilized PG mechanics for damage and teleported me to mobs or mobs to me to kill - probably one of the more unique hacks out there.</p>
<h3 id=2008---jump-down>2008 - Jump Down</h3>
<p>Wow, can you imagine there wasn't a way to jump off a platform to the one below before this? This was a fun and convenient little action that helped getting around. It also introduced the ability to clip through the floor if jumping down onto a vertical barrier, sit on air by sitting on a bench above but jumping down at the same time, resulting in sitting on the lower platform under the original bench, and some more exploitable movements.</p>
<h3 id=2008---world-demethos>2008 - World: Demethos</h3>
<p>This would end up being my main world. It's possible that I played a little before this but I don't remember much of that time. The skull icon is sick!</p>
<h3 id=2009---temple-of-time>2009 - Temple of Time</h3>
<p>One of my favorite areas; the music is good, and the mobs were arguably the coolest in the game at the time. This area features some of my favorite soundtracks. Also, the Pink Bean is at the end.</p>
<h3 id=2009---class-cygnus-knights>2009 - Class: Cygnus Knights</h3>
<p>An entirely new storyline, and another area of my favorite soundtracks. I remember my first Cygnus Knight was a Thunderbreaker, which was their version of pirate, as I didn't play one yet - also, they got a very cool super saiyan transform skill. There were also nice bonuses for having a Cygnus Knight linked with other characters, and they had extremely flashy skills overall.</p>
<p>Another thing each Cygnus Knight had was a tiny sprite that could be summoned alongside and automatically attack enemies within range. With a little clever editing of the game files, this sprite could do huge map-wide attacks. Unfortunately, the damage was fixed, so it was only useful at lower levels, like at HPQ. I remember using it there blatantly in front of people, and I don't think they suspected it was a thing because I claimed it was a buffed version.</p>
<h3 id=2009---class-aran>2009 - Class: Aran</h3>
<p>Arans introduced yet another new class and storyline. It also introduced a unique playstyle - auto attack until you hit enough things to build up a combo and release a power move. The auto attack was the first one that could mob (hit multiple mobs). There was also a funny exploit where the intro gameplay for an Aran started you off at level 200, where you get knocked out and become a weakling, but if you knew what to do, you could escape the intro and get a free level 200 Aran.</p>
<p>But being a level 200 Aran only bypasses the grind, as both Arans and Cygnus Knights were required to complete certain questlines to unlock skills and other things - this is a theme that would appear for any non-explorer class (explorer being the base thief/mage/bowman/warrior/pirate classes.)</p>
<h3 id=2009---new-tutorial-for-explorers>2009 - New Tutorial for Explorers</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if this is what I think it is, but it was a revamp of the tutorial. You start in a factory of some sort, and there's a conveyer belt I think; I don't remember much… But it also introduced a lot of new starting gear when creating your character. They were just cosmetics with no stats, but when you're like me (cheap), you take anything you can get!</p>
<h3 id=2010---monster-survival-pq>2010 - Monster Survival PQ</h3>
<p>Hehe, the true casual botting scene has arrived. Monster Survival PQ, which I learned is another name for Nett's Pyramid, was probably the easiest and most lucrative thing to ever exist for botters. It consisted of killing an endless stream of undead monsters and giving rewards based on performance, up to a cap. With all the new mobbing classes, it was extremely easy to bot. Certain client file mods could do things like make mobs only walk in one direction that helped to group them up in a relatively undetectable manner. Me? I played a cleric so I could spam heal, which damaged undead monsters, all the way through. Combined with MP Eater, I'd be permanently topped off, and there was no need for UA (unlimited attacks) because I'm constantly being knocked around by mobs. The rewards were massive, and I often had several characters botting it at the same time 23/7.</p>
<h3 id=2010---class-evan>2010 - Class: Evan</h3>
<p>Yet another class released in Maplestory's attempt to drive its story. It was a unique class featuring a permanent dragon partner, but I never really invested in one. On the other hand, one of my friends that I provided Holy Symbol, a buff that gives bonus experience, to was one of the first level 200 Evans on the server, if I remember correctly.</p>
<h3 id=2010---boss-chaos-zakum-and-chaos-horntail>2010 - Boss: Chaos Zakum and Chaos Horntail</h3>
<p>Nothing much to say except I was in one of the first few raids to beat this on my server.</p>
<h3 id=2010---follow-system>2010 - Follow System</h3>
<p>This probably wasn't much overall, but still allowed various small but interesting exploits. There was a small guard against following someone with movement skills e.g. Flash Jump or Teleport, but toggling follow at the correct time could bypass it for one "movement." Best used with a gunslinger's Wings skill which allowed slower descent for you and, therefore, your follower. I used to fly people to places typically unreachable to their class for fun.</p>
<h3 id=2010---potential-item-system>2010 - Potential Item System</h3>
<p>Aka the system that broke the balance of Maplestory. Imagine picking up an item that suddenly increases your main stat by 20%. Or one that gives a slightly weakened version of a class's signature move e.g. Holy Symbol or Hyper Body (increased health). It's actually crazy that they added it, although I assume it was a p2w move as it came with Cash Shop items for re-rolling potentials and whatnot.</p>
<h3 id=2010---big-bang>2010 - BIG BANG</h3>
<p>Huge change. I don't know where to start. It's an entirely new game at this point. At least it did better than Maplestory 2!</p>
<h3 id=2011---lion-kings-castlecastle-of-von-leon>2011 - Lion King's Castle/Castle of Von Leon</h3>
<p>This was <em>the</em> place to train when it was released. Mobs here were extremely tough, required a few damage players to take down, and gave a ton of experience. Couple that with experience bonuses for hunting in parties, and a 2x experience event, people would be queuing up for these maps for hours. Fortunately, as a Bishop, I could easily get into a party needing Holy Symbol and just needed to press it every couple of minutes or so to keep the buff up. Which reminds me of another client side mod that changed the range of HS to be map-wide rather than a small area around the character.</p>
<h3 id=2011---gate-to-the-futureboss-empress>2011 - Gate to the Future/Boss: Empress</h3>
<p>Nothing much to say here, except brag again I was in one of the first successful raids against this boss.</p>
<h3 id=2011---player-vs-player-pvp>2011 - Player-vs-Player (PvP)</h3>
<h3 id=2011---capture-the-flag>2011 - Capture the Flag</h3>
<p>I don't remember which was which, but one funny thing was how unbalanced Bishops were in PvP. Their main attack skill, Shining Ray, was aoe damage and stun. They also had a skill called Doom which turned people into snails. I often got the hacker comment for using Doom, and, at this point, I wasn't actually hacking as this account was "important" and I didn't want to risk it.</p>
<h3 id=2011---silent-crusadecrusader-codex>2011 - Silent Crusade/Crusader Codex</h3>
<p>This is the last thing I remember doing on my main account, hunting down various mobs and mini-bosses to collect their cards, as I was fully geared at this point and just hung around in towns or did basic things. I must have been locked out sometime recently after this. I won't really go into my return to the game as it's quite casual and uneventful.</p>
<p>One memory that I'd like to bring up is how I attended my first (virtual) wedding in Maplestory. It was for my guild leader, who said he was a veteran, and he bought a wedding ticket from the Cash Shop. I'm not sure who the virtual girlfriend/wife was, or if they knew each other in real life. I do remember the guild leader spending a lot of in-game money for her, though. The wedding was fun, and there were random after-wedding events and rewards. I even gave them some kind of wedding gift, but I've forgotten what it was.</p>
<p>Another memory would be the first time I killed the balrogs that sometimes attack on the ship to Orbis, then inviting everyone outside because it was safe to come out.</p>
<p>And one where I finally hit max mesos on a character (it's the 2^31 -1 number!)</p>
<p>Also one where I was able to reconnect with a friend months after not seeing them - he used to be a trusty damage dealer while I was a trusty support. He disappeared for a bit, but then I ran into him in an area we first met at, and we played together until I was banned. Hi, Boredsback if you're reading this… or was it Boredisback? I don't remember.</p>
<p>A classic one is me spending my Christmas decorating the in-game tree by dropping items in front of it with some friends. My most coveted item may be a star that glows when dropped.</p>
<p>Dang, I wish I had <em>any</em> record of my time back then. I would rate the game as used to be good but, now, based on what I hear, it's kind of whatever.</p>
<h2 id=dungeon-fighter-online>dungeon fighter online</h2>
<h2 id=dungeon-n-fighter-kr>dungeon n fighter (KR)</h2>
<p>I'd say DFO wasn't a game I try-harded much at, but instead one where I may have contributed to the botting scheme that eventually crashed the game's economy and killed the initial release. Yes, I played legitimately and had full sets of gears with special bonuses for Crusaders, but I mainly spent my time helping a few people mess with the game - it wasn't too difficult as it was centered around packet capture and editing.</p>
<p>There were some unique hacks, like using various consumables without actually needing them, but the important hacks centered around three things: hitting things on screen for a maximum amount of damage, god-mode, and automatic movement/looting; it was very straightforward, and bots could easily run through dungeons and collect rewards. At the height (or lowest point) of the game, I could watch tens or hundreds of bots with gibberish names entering and exiting dungeons every few seconds. There used to be a fatigue system that limited how much one could play or get rewarded per day, but that was removed, and the game slowly died after.</p>
<p>After it died, I was invited to play the Korean version, which required some kind of Korean citizen identifier to register for. I was given an account to play with though, so I didn't have to mess with that. I also remember having to use IE and downloading some kind of extension… My main in-game memory of that is not understanding any of the text, trying to speak to some random players in English, asking my friend to translate what they're saying, and him telling me that everyone was calling me a Yankee. Hilarious!</p>
<p>Of course, there was a re-release of the game for the global audience, and I was pulled back into my old group. This time, I tried to play both sides; legitimate icon and shady icon. I even hosted a legitimate PvP tournament early on… which one? The one where a community manager accidentally left his "hit things on screen automatically" hack on stream and was subsequently banned a bit later. If I remember correctly, the fact that he was a community manager wasn't released yet, but <em>another</em> community manager leaked some Skype chats that showed proof. Unfortunately it seems the drama has disappeared to the void because the website didn't allow crawling and the domain has been bought out.</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/71/hacker.mp4></p>
<p>Those are the hacks I worked on being demoed! Man, just seeing that UI I made for the tournament on the right brings back memories. It is a beautiful monster - now that I'm looking at it, I instantly have ideas on how to improve it: center the names and mirror one of the portraits. I didn't have much design sense back then, as I only had to design menus. I'm not going to lie, I did quite a poor job hosting the tournament as I remember having trouble just keeping the graphics and bracket updated.</p>
<p>Part of this tournament was an impromptu fight between two of the top(?) American(?) players and a transfer student from Korea who happened to be a pro player for the game because the caster disconnected. I found that funny because I remember someone just spamming a huge aoe to zone the Korean player and the other guy taking shots.</p>
<p><video controls src=/blobs/71/teamwork.mp4></p>
<p>We quickly see how two people team up against one despite it being a free for all fight - very interesting! Sorry for the audio cutting out, I assume I'm switching windows to talk with the caster. Full recordings of that tournament exist, but you'll have to find them yourself. They are from 2015, and, if you're wondering, the professional player (JungJam) won overall.</p>
<p>But in the end, I didn't have much interest in playing the game again, and this time it showed - I stopped having anything to do with it. Also, they kept the fatigue system up this time, which comes with pros and cons. I guess I used to spend an over-average amount of time on games, so I would need more fatigue points than the average player.</p>
<p>I'd rate the game as very fun! But, like most games, devolves into an grueling grind that is limited due to limited entries into endgame dungeons per day and the fatigue system. PvP is also fun, but DFO PvP seems to be greatly impacted by lag compared to PvP in other games.</p>
<h2 id=combat-arms>combat arms</h2>
<p>And now a shooter. I seem to remember Combat Arms boasting a ton of weapons and modifications, but at the end of the day, there are only a few meta picks, so no, I did not care for that. I took a little interest in the normal PvP game modes like Search and Destroy and Elimination Pro, but spent most of my time on the game modes Quarantine and Fireteam, reaching a decent rank with a solid 2.0+ KD ratio. The rank was a vertical silver stripe.</p>
<p>Quarantine is the standard zombie mode, where a few players are infected and need to infect other players. Non-infected players either try to eliminate the infected or stay alive. There were several aspects to Quarantine that I really enjoyed. First of all, some maps were huge and allowed hiding in very clever spots, my favorites being either under the bridge on Kill Creek or on the backside of a net that acts as a ladder in Two Towers. Hiding spots don't always have to be in corners, though. A classic hiding spot I had in Overdose was to just crouch against a wall by some props, and it had a quite high success rate. There were more offensive strategies, and they typically involve explosives - the most effective weapons against infected. Setting 3 mines on a choke point could instantly kill infected, and bringing LAWs, RPGs, and HE grenades could greatly help destroy them in other scenarios. In Overdose, there were a couple of safe rooms that opened after a set amount of time which could allow for amazing setups while infected try to break in. If there is no safe room and I was discovered, I could typically try out-parkouring infected movement by jumping around on obstacles.</p>
<p>Fireteam is a co-op game mode where players fight against NPCs. There were many, but the one I remember best is Cabin Fever, which is basic zombie wave survival. A few rounds in and there probably won't be enough firepower to keep infected out of the cabin, and you end up having to run circles around the cabin while they follow. I think I've only beaten it legitimately a few times, but illegitimately… many times, which brings me to the more unique hacks for Combat Arms. All FPS games and shooters have a typical array of hacks, which include things that modify weapons like no recoil or no spread, and hacks that give extra information like chams, esp, or wallhacks. Combat Arms had two unique hacks which were dubbed OPK (one position kill) and telekill (teleport kill). What they did is teleport you to an enemy, or an enemy to you, so you could attack forward, typically with a melee weapon, and hit them. Naturally, this kind of hack made Fireteam missions easy (and could make any PvP game mode easy, but I didn't use them there… usually). These things could be combined with a client side mod that changed the fire rate of weapons (including melee) for very quick kills.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that the weapons could only be purchased for fixed periods of time. Maybe I should say rented. I did end up spending some money on a permanent K5SD though… not sure I leveraged it much. I enjoyed the game, but I think the movement and gameplay was a little slow and clunky.</p>
<h2 id=crossfire>crossfire</h2>
<p>Another shooter? This one is unique in that it is the only MMO that I played with a friend that I knew in real life. Like Combat Arms, I was mainly a fan of its unique game modes like Mutation Mode and Ghost Mode.</p>
<p>Ghost Mode consists of semi-invisible melee only players attempting to plant a bomb and normal players trying to prevent the bomb or defuse it after its planted. Being a ghost was definitely a lot funner as it had some nice skill caps around movement - moving is supposed to be revealing, but a combination of jumping, crouching, and strafing, could allow one to move almost as efficiently as running while remaining fully stealthed. It could only be done backwards, but you could turn around mid jumps to see where you were going. The other counter to ghosts was being heard breathing, but the technique to avoid this is to not spend much time by normal players - just drive-by melee them. Arguably a good ghost was very hard to defeat. I played it so much that I literally had numerous specific techniques and tactics that I would use in most games. On the other hand, as a normal player, you get ranged weaponry - camping in hard to reach areas and spraying in the direction of breathing noises is about as good as it got at high levels. Or maybe catch a glimpse of a ghost? Or just have hacks to show where ghosts are… I may have made and used something like that a few times.</p>
<p>Mutation Mode is the zombie mode. There are two approaches for this game's version; hide or defend. But there were also various interesting glitches that I used to get to interesting spots. First of all, it was possible to clip into geometry by quickly running forward and backwards on top of a corner. This could be done in a lot of areas, but eventually was patched out and would crash the client with an error if detected. Or you would enter a killbox. The other thing I liked to do was "fly" with my friend. It involved clipping two characters together and jumping at the same time. As long as no one moved and jumping was done properly, we would slowly ascend into the air - we could either camp in mid air or drop down onto some geometry that isn't meant to be reached. That was fun.</p>
<p>I had many accounts for some reason… I think I was testing out hacks on them. But the highest ranked one was also a silver stripe, like in Combat Arms. I don't know if that's a coincidence or if I did it intentionally. It was a fun game with not many downsides.</p>
<p>There are a few other fps games, but I don't really have much to say about them except that I spent a lot of time playing and hacking them: GunZ: The Duel, Alliance of Valiant Arms, Battlefield Heroes, and Battlefield Play4Free.</p>
<h2 id=league-of-legends>league of legends</h2>
<p>Of course I played this. It was the cool thing at the time. And it seems to still be the cool thing, although you have to complain about it, too.</p>
<p>Hmm, how can I explain my time on the game - all I can say is I hit level 30, then started playing ranked games, eventually hitting 2.1k elo - this was back when they had the elo system instead of tiers. Ah, now that I think about it I used to level and sell accounts on this game. God, it's interesting to realize that I don't have many memories of this game except that I spent a <em>ton</em> of time on it.</p>
<p>Oh, also I remember I had the opportunity to give feedback on the game once, and I said something like "stop adding so many champions because only a few will matter while the rest just sit there!"… I see the game now and I don't even recognize half of them.</p>
<p>Well, I'm sure the game is still good considering its popularity. I'll do a little aside for DOTA 2, too as I played that casually with friends. Back then, I would say League of Legends was a lot simpler and streamlined compared to DOTA 2. There are mechanics like blocking creeps, disjointing projectiles, turn speed, micro, and more that you just didn't find in League of Legends that were present in DOTA 2. But yes, both are fun in their own capacity.</p>
<h2 id=path-of-exile>path of exile</h2>
<p>I don't know how I got into this game, but I enjoyed it. I think I played between the Domination and Ambush leagues, but stopped playing after that because… grindfest. I did have my Righteous Fire level 100 character by then and hundreds of exalts so I felt like the game was basically completed for me.</p>
<p>I did get back into the game for Delve and Betrayal, but felt like it was getting to be pretty complex. Do games without sequels just get too complex after a certain point in time? Am I getting <em>old</em>?</p>
<h2 id=tera>tera</h2>
<p>Ah TERA, I actually <a href=/posts/52>wrote about it</a> recently because it shut down. I never truly hit endgame, as the grind is stupid long (random chance upgrades, limited dungeon entries, content constantly being scaled), but I enjoyed the game because I had a consistent friend to play with.</p>
<h2 id=warframe>warframe</h2>
<p>How about a third (person) shooter? I started playing Warframe on the suggestion of the same friend who got me into Guild Wars 2! However, this time there were other people playing the game with us, but that didn't stop me from quitting the game - the game was unique in terms of movement, but really was a grindfest; we would try to grind endless void missions for prime blueprints.</p>
<p>Well, I came back a bit later by myself and started playing the game regularly: I went super meta and started helping with the drop table data mining as it was important for my try-hardiness. I was able to become pretty good at the game, or at least find extremely efficient playstyles - kill everything before they can kill you - and basically rolled the game, achieving basically everything important to achieve. Here's are some random youtube playlists of videos I took; by this time I knew it would be a good idea to start recording things!</p>
<ul>
<li>PLFcNSaFKsff(sex)-IuJiCg(i)_ihl_GMf(nein)M9VA</li>
<li>PLFcNSaFKsff(svn)d(tree)wcpkzuvE96(tres)pogEGHJ(ate)</li>
<li>PLFcNSaFKsff(for)nNOzhwVFHpU(zed)_hptVSm(sox)j</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep, just random gameplay videos and nothing too specific. What is interesting is how our little data mining team slowly turned into reverse engineering the client, and this "little" reverse engineering allowed us to stand up our own private Warframe server (written in PHP no less!) Most of the actual game is in the client and the server was mainly like a database back then; it was fun to figure out how to patch the client so it would talk to our server instead. This also led to some more questionable actions, as we also figured out how to reward ourselves with whatever we wanted and saving the results <em>to the official servers</em>. When this happened, the figurehead quickly rounded up a few select people to continue doing this, and other people, including myself, were out. That didn't stop Digital Extremes from sending a cease and desist to us, well the figurehead, and stuff happened, but I was not privy to the matter by that point.</p>
<p>Oh, I also got banned once for hacking, but was able to revert it as support told me everyone has one freebie, well I guess I won't stretch my luck anymore!</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about the game was the set of unique weapons and mods. I would spend tons of time trying out new combinations to maximize my damage, and came across some off-meta choices that were pretty good, or at least until the big weapon changes that came with a patch. The build was this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Primary - Mutalist Quanta Alternate Fire Spam<ul>
<li>Combined with Bursting Mass and focusing damage on the alternate fire, this ends up being a huge aoe spamming weapon with no self damage. Quite convenient for just hitting things in a large area.</li></ul></li>
<li>Secondary - Twin Kohmak<ul>
<li>An extremely overlooked secondary, basically a crazy but ammo inefficient bullet hose.</li></ul></li>
<li>Melee - Plague Kripath<ul>
<li>A pretty standard melee build, as I just used melee most of the time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Frame - Nekros Prime<ul>
<li>The frame doesn't really matter, as I did not need survivability or damage boosts, so I used Nekros for the unique passive extra loot utility.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These ranged weapons also benefit from a high Riven disposition, which I took advantage of. Eventually the game does get repetitive and grindy, though. I quit a little before the release of the Orphix Venom event, as the game really started to lose a sense of direction - there was a lot of content, but it all turned out to be very shallow. I did have basically everything that could be had up to and including Railjacks, but after that it felt like an endless race for completionists like me. Steam says I have 3k hours, and I feel like the in-game timer would say around 2k hours in missions. BUT surprise! I'm installing it right now (or have already installed it), let's see if my Framework can handle it; I hope there's not too much new stuff to get into.</p>
<p>Some of these games still exist, and some of my accounts do, too. It's crazy to calculate how much time I've spent messing around on games… It's probably over a tenth of my current life, and definitely is if we factor in the non-MMO games!</p>
<p>So I did get to check Warframe out a bit before submitting this post, and let's take a look at some quick screenshots that I took as I renewed myself with it:</p>
<p><img alt="daily reward" src=/blobs/71/daily.png></p>
<p>My first daily reward when I come back after a couple years seems to be a 75% percent off platinum coupon! These are somewhat rare, as I only remember getting maybe 2 in my years of playing, so I don't know if this is a coincidence or not. In fact, the first one I got was extremely early on when I started playing the game, and the last one I got was very near the time I quit the game. Is time a flat circle? Am I starting to play the game again? And here are my general stats:</p>
<p><img alt="playtime summary" src=/blobs/71/summary.png></p>
<p>2k hours was close and the statistics are nice enough to convert that into days for us… 79 days! And around 14 hours spent on solving ciphers (a small puzzle that's part of the game mechanics for unlocking doors); crazy! I see they've added some new areas since I've gone, as my star chart progress is not maxed out. I was also assaulted by around 10 new messages for events that occurred during the time I was out - a lot of things changed so here's some kind of refund - and ended up with a round a week of free boosters. There does seem to be a decent amount of new content - at least 3 quest lines. After a little looking around the game, I came across this:</p>
<p><img alt="ui glitch" src=/blobs/71/glitched.png></p>
<p>Uh yeah the game glitched so I had to shut it off. Overall, it does seem like my low spec laptop can handle it which is interesting because the graphics don't seem too outdated in my opinion. This may be the game I'll be playing in the near future!</p>
<h2 id=aside>aside</h2>
<p>I also think this is an good time to note that my gaming setup consisted of literally just a laptop for a while; no external mouse, keyboard, or displays.</p>
<p>Playing on a trackpad led to a lot of interesting techniques - my most common one being flicking by quickly touching two different areas on it to simulate a quick swiping motion. It was very useful for any high paced game. This would be quite a suspicious technique as the teleporting mouse or camera view was mistaken for aimbotting. There was also precision aiming by just rolling my finger across the trackpad rather than dragging it.</p>
<p>An interesting observation I made before is that on my first laptop, which had an indented pattern on its shell, the area to the left of the trackpad was rubbed smooth due to heavy usage of wasd controls. Similarly, the trackpad had a plasticky cover where the center portion was also rubbed off and the trackpad button's coloring was worn off at the corners due to excessive clicking.</p>
<p>I eventually did sidegrade to a simple 2 button mouse, as my second laptop came with buttons integrated with the touchpad which were terrible to use. However, I would say going to a 2 button mouse was a hard downgrade for games with a lot of hotkeys as my right hand was on the mouse instead of the keyboard and I lost quick access to the right side of the keyboard.</p>
<p>I upgraded to a mouse with 2 extra side buttons just last year, which felt a little awkward to use but ended up being quite useful for movement tech in Guild Wars 2. But so far I haven't leveraged the buttons elsewhere.</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+# my time on mmos</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;ve recently just stopped playing Guild Wars 2, which is the game I hinted at</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in my [yearly reflection](/posts/62) and realized this is probably the first</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+couple of months where I haven&#x27;t spent some time on massively multiplayer online</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+games (MMOs) - in fact, I&#x27;m not sure I will pick one up in the future now that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+my [current laptop](/posts/63) has extremely low specs. Because of this, I&#x27;ve</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+decided to look back and review various aspects of MMOs that I regularly played,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+including things like how I got into them (I believe there&#x27;s a common threat),</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+how far into the endgame I was, my experiences and opinions, and other things I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+consider fun or interesting to know. We&#x27;ll start with Guild Wars 2, as it was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+last, then go in an order that lets me distribute graphics evenly :).</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## guild wars 2</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The interesting thing here is that I typically do not pay money for games. I got</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+into Guild Wars 2 because I sent a friend a \$50 prepaid card for his birthday.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+He ended up spending around half of it on Guild Wars 2, and wanted me to also</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+play it so I, like the cheap person I am, used the other half of the money on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the card to purchase my own copy with his blessing.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+For the next two or so months, we hit max level (not really an achievement in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this game) and played through both the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+expansions. After this, he kind of dropped off and I was left to play by myself.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Over the next two years, I would end up getting full legendary equipment for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+medium armor classes, obtain basically maxed out characters for each profession</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+(professions are classes like thief warrior etc), have around 16000 achievement</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+points, and play through most aspects of the game, including the newest</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+expansion... which I bought.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Like most MMOs, initial progression is kind of boring - many activities give</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+experience quickly get repetitive. When I quit, I understood that they were</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+testing out new experience curves to help with this. Once you hit max level,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+there are suddenly many more things you can do - Guild Wars 2 touts horizontal</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+progression, and this is where it kind of comes in. It&#x27;s typically</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+straightforward to get &quot;good&quot; gear (just ~5% worse than the best gear!), and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+changing your characters&#x27; combat skills is free, which means not much time is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spent on prepping a max-level character. In fact, gearing is irrelevant if you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+are a PvPer, as equipment there is standardized (there is another kind of PvP</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+game mode where gear does matter, though).</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Gear is simple in the game; a few combinations of stats exist, and any piece of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+gear can have that combination. The three (two) highest tiers of gear are</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+exotic, ascended, and legendary. Exotic gear with most stat combinations can be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+acquired easily, ascended can be acquired somewhat easily and offers a minuscule</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+boost, and legendary takes forever to acquire and is only better than ascended</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in quality of life features.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Once you&#x27;ve picked up a semi-meta build, you may continue to the main PvE</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+activities, which are going to be achievement hunting, doing events, or raiding.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Achievement hunting is diverse and includes things like collecting items,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+completing jumping puzzles, or satisfying other criteria. Achievements can lead</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to better gear and other unique rewards and are usually straightforward, but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+perhaps tasking, to perform. I only had around 16k achievement points, where a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+maximum of 50k - 60k exist, but 16k is arguably quite respectable, and I would</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+say 30k is like a longtime consistent player.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Doing events is probably an interesting one, as there are generic events that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+occur on timers around the world that are open to anyone. Some of them require a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+very tiny amount of teamwork and skill - in some cases, too much. Many of the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+existing large events are set at an elementary level where minimum effort is</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+required to receive rewards, which seems to have had a certain effect on the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+general player base. Other events, like the Dragon&#x27;s End meta, that initially</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+had a high failure rate, were slowly nerfed to fit the average player. The</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+events are fun at first, but the more difficult ones become annoying once you</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+realize you cannot really control much in a group of 50 random players.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Raiding is the typical MMO type of raid. It uses the standard group composition</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of support/tank/damage dealers and has some unique mechanics to work around.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There are also strikes, which are a kind of compressed raid with only one boss.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There are also fractals, which some people would disagree as categorizing as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+raids, where party composition is free-er (typically all damage) and consists of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+several types of dungeons. All of these fights include challenge motes, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+can make them more difficult for more rewards or achievements. Like all</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+activities, these were interesting at first, but quickly grew boring and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+repetitive. The main issue around this is running with less experienced/more</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+casual players who don&#x27;t quantify the impact or learn mechanics that drag the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+group down. Guild Wars 2 allows addons and mods, like ArcDPS, which can be used</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to track damage among other stats. I also know they introduced a kind of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+beginner mode for raids to help things along.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+As for PvP, there is structured Player versus Player (sPvP) and World Versus</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+World (WvW). I will skip over sPvP.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+WvW is where I spent the entire second half of my time. This is a server versus</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+server game mode, hence world. The idea behind this game mode is to capture and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+hold various structures in maps, but not many care about that. The things people</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+cared about were matchups, experience, and fights.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The matchup is slightly related to capturing and holding as that activity</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+determines the score and, therefore, which servers will be fought in the next</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+match - specific servers have specific types of players which may or may not be</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+fun to play against. Experience is strictly to get rewards, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+capturing/fighting is what nets experience. Holding kind of does; it is only</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+relevant if there are enemies to defend against. Fights are probably the thing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that most WvW players enjoy, as it consists of groups of 20-50+ players running</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at each other in a somewhat coordinated fashion - nothing beats smashing a group</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+twice your size as usually numbers matter, but sometimes they don&#x27;t - public</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+groups have more people but a wider distribution of skill, private groups</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+typically have higher quality players but fewer of them. Eventually, I got tired</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of this, though, and went on to do guild versus guild (GvG) which is the same</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+thing, but where the sides consist of try-hard players who focus on fighting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+other try-hard players exclusively. It&#x27;s probably the funnest game mode, as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+fights do have a few consistent themes but are more random and require a lot</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+more coordination to do well in.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Here&#x27;s a clip of casual GvG where I pull, then knock around a guildmate so he</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+dies.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;video controls src=&quot;/blobs/71/arcane.mp4&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;m not really listening to the commander, but getting a pick is sometimes</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+actually better. This kind of single target gameplay is table stakes for GvG as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it&#x27;s extremely efficient... except it was a casual one and my troll gameplay</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+caused a bit of drama as it turns out I was knocking around a server admin in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+other rounds (certain professions are better for targeting as they have less</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+survivability). I have a full recording and more in the following youtube</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+playlist: PLFcNSaFKsff(sx)dzOzjZbzVNa-Nj-uw(uno)ox(nein); replace the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+parenthesized text with the single digit number.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I did end up quitting because WvW was the only thing keeping me in, and I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+couldn&#x27;t find a high skilled but casual guild that matched my taste. And my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+current guild did disband - though I&#x27;ll partly attribute it to the toxic</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+try-hard mentality that was introduced over the past few months.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+If I had to summarize Guild Wars 2, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a good game with diverse</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+content, the only grind is the one you set for yourself, and if you&#x27;re looking</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to enjoy the entire game, find some proper people to play with; well, that&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+true for all MMOs, isn&#x27;t it?</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+Casual cartoony game time!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I don&#x27;t think I really played this game that much, but it did leave an</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+impression on me - perhaps it had to do with math brain. The core gameplay</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+involved firing projectiles at other players based on a picked angle/power and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+taking wind into account. Depending on what you picked, projectiles would also</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+have interesting effects such as attracting nearby players to the impact area,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+or tunneling underground. It was an extremely fun game and I&#x27;m not sure why it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+shut down; maybe because the skill ceiling was kind of low - once you know how</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to aim then it&#x27;s basically game over. Aimbots were kind of easy to implement,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it&#x27;s one of those scenarios where the hacks could be external to the game</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+itself. Imagine inputting wind speed, distance, and height difference into a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+calculator and getting angle and power out; although this way doesn&#x27;t exactly</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+factor special mechanics in.</span>

<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Like most of my early games, I think I was drawn to these 3 because of their</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+graphics and simplicity. Top that off with a ton of content, it was quite good.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The only downside would be that all of these had very little player interaction.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, also I&#x27;ll mention that after a certain point of playing these games, I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+just used trainers to bypass various barriers and explore more easily - it&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+interesting how simple making trainers for these games were. I feel like I was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+able to cover a solid amount of the content in these games, but there always</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+seemed to be more.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## maplestory</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, of course I had to write something about this game, didn&#x27;t I? I honestly</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+consider going back to it quite often, but I know it&#x27;s changed a lot so this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+review will be extremely out of date.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I figure I played since 2005 because that&#x27;s when PICs were introduced, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+played up until... 2011? Based on what I remember of the game and what I&#x27;m</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+reading of the patch notes, sometime between the MapleStory Legends and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+MapleStory Alliance Rising patches is when my first main account was banned.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There&#x27;s probably a year or two in there that I didn&#x27;t play the game, then picked</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it up a bit after as I&#x27;m familiar with some things mentioned in the later patch</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+notes. Looking at an [older post](/posts/18) about the game, I claim 2014, so</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+let&#x27;s go with that.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Of course, as explained in the post mentioned above, my early time consisted of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+just walking around and exploring the world after luckily coming across a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+relatively large amount of mesos (money) to fund the exploration. Now that I&#x27;m</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+looking closer at what I said in that post, I assume that the period of quitting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was sometime between 2007 and 2008, as the trashmail year suggests my main</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+account was created then - I do remember they offered new domains depending on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the year so it may be after. I also remember the existence of Demethos. Either</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+way, when I got back into the game, I started grinding.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I will use the following [timeline](http://www.southperry.net/timeline.php) to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+mention anything I remember about these releases or events, and then comment on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+anything I think of in between.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2005 - Cash Shop Opens</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I remember I used to sit in the Cash Shop for a long time just trying things</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out. And the music is fantastic and chill. I guess I was like a window shopper</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in that sense.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2006 - Omega Sector</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2006 - Aqua Road</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2006 - Amoria</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I remember the release of these areas as I immediately traveled to check them</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how I got through Omega Sector and Aqua Road as a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+level 19 player, but perhaps it used to be scaled down. Also, the release of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Amoria was amazing as it was probably one of the largest maps to date and very</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+romantic to boot!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2007 - Henesys PQ/Ludi Maze PQ</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2007 - Prendergast Mansion (Haunted House)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Henesys party quest (HPQ) was an interesting one, not because of the actual</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+gameplay, but because it led to specialized roles to cheese the PQ. The PQ was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+completed after obtaining 10(?) rice cakes and any extras should be removed from</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+your inventory after leaving the area, but this could be bypassed. This led to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the creation of smugglers, who were able to &quot;smuggle&quot; rice cakes out of the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+area - leading to the ability to finish the PQ quickly. Another role was someone</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that could lure - The main task, depending a bunny that created rice cakes, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&quot;lurers&quot; would use Pico-Pico Hammers (weapons with minimum attack stats) to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+attack and lure enemies into a corner of the map. More wouldn&#x27;t spawn until the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+current enemies were killed.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+PQs overall were a fun activity, although a lot of them involved brute-forcing a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+code in their stages e.g.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- Kerning PQ - Have 3 people hang on 3 of the correct ropes out of 4.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- KPQ - have 3 people stand on the correct 3 platforms out of 5.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- Ludibrium PQ - guess the right box out of 3 15 times in a row. (fixed answer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    though)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- LPQ - stand on the correct 5 boxes out of 9.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And probably more that I&#x27;m forgetting. I do know PQs were later greatly</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+simplified. Talking about LPQ also reminds me of one of my favorite skills;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Power Guard. It damages enemies when you get damaged and could be used to kill</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&quot;unkillable&quot; enemies or enemies of much higher levels, as long as you had the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+health to withstand their attacks. This led to many other things, too, like my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+favorite hack, which utilized PG mechanics for damage and teleported me to mobs</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+or mobs to me to kill - probably one of the more unique hacks out there.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2008 - Jump Down</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Wow, can you imagine there wasn&#x27;t a way to jump off a platform to the one below</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+before this? This was a fun and convenient little action that helped getting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+around. It also introduced the ability to clip through the floor if jumping down</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+onto a vertical barrier, sit on air by sitting on a bench above but jumping down</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at the same time, resulting in sitting on the lower platform under the original</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+bench, and some more exploitable movements.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2008 - World: Demethos</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This would end up being my main world. It&#x27;s possible that I played a little</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+before this but I don&#x27;t remember much of that time. The skull icon is sick!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2009 - Temple of Time</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+One of my favorite areas; the music is good, and the mobs were arguably the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+coolest in the game at the time. This area features some of my favorite</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+soundtracks. Also, the Pink Bean is at the end.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2009 - Class: Cygnus Knights</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+An entirely new storyline, and another area of my favorite soundtracks. I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+remember my first Cygnus Knight was a Thunderbreaker, which was their version of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+pirate, as I didn&#x27;t play one yet - also, they got a very cool super saiyan</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+transform skill. There were also nice bonuses for having a Cygnus Knight linked</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with other characters, and they had extremely flashy skills overall.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Another thing each Cygnus Knight had was a tiny sprite that could be summoned</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+alongside and automatically attack enemies within range. With a little clever</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+editing of the game files, this sprite could do huge map-wide attacks.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Unfortunately, the damage was fixed, so it was only useful at lower levels, like</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at HPQ. I remember using it there blatantly in front of people, and I don&#x27;t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+think they suspected it was a thing because I claimed it was a buffed version.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2009 - Class: Aran</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Arans introduced yet another new class and storyline. It also introduced a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+unique playstyle - auto attack until you hit enough things to build up a combo</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and release a power move. The auto attack was the first one that could mob (hit</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+multiple mobs). There was also a funny exploit where the intro gameplay for an</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Aran started you off at level 200, where you get knocked out and become a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+weakling, but if you knew what to do, you could escape the intro and get a free</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+level 200 Aran.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+But being a level 200 Aran only bypasses the grind, as both Arans and Cygnus</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Knights were required to complete certain questlines to unlock skills and other</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+things - this is a theme that would appear for any non-explorer class (explorer</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+being the base thief/mage/bowman/warrior/pirate classes.)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2009 - New Tutorial for Explorers</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;m not sure if this is what I think it is, but it was a revamp of the tutorial.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+You start in a factory of some sort, and there&#x27;s a conveyer belt I think; I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+don&#x27;t remember much... But it also introduced a lot of new starting gear when</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+creating your character. They were just cosmetics with no stats, but when you&#x27;re</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+like me (cheap), you take anything you can get!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - Monster Survival PQ</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Hehe, the true casual botting scene has arrived. Monster Survival PQ, which I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+learned is another name for Nett&#x27;s Pyramid, was probably the easiest and most</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+lucrative thing to ever exist for botters. It consisted of killing an endless</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+stream of undead monsters and giving rewards based on performance, up to a cap.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+With all the new mobbing classes, it was extremely easy to bot. Certain client</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+file mods could do things like make mobs only walk in one direction that helped</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to group them up in a relatively undetectable manner. Me? I played a cleric so I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+could spam heal, which damaged undead monsters, all the way through. Combined</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with MP Eater, I&#x27;d be permanently topped off, and there was no need for UA</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+(unlimited attacks) because I&#x27;m constantly being knocked around by mobs. The</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+rewards were massive, and I often had several characters botting it at the same</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+time 23/7.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - Class: Evan</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Yet another class released in Maplestory&#x27;s attempt to drive its story. It was a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+unique class featuring a permanent dragon partner, but I never really invested</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+in one. On the other hand, one of my friends that I provided Holy Symbol, a buff</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that gives bonus experience, to was one of the first level 200 Evans on the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+server, if I remember correctly.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - Boss: Chaos Zakum and Chaos Horntail</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Nothing much to say except I was in one of the first few raids to beat this on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+my server.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - Follow System</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This probably wasn&#x27;t much overall, but still allowed various small but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+interesting exploits. There was a small guard against following someone with</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+movement skills e.g. Flash Jump or Teleport, but toggling follow at the correct</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+time could bypass it for one &quot;movement.&quot; Best used with a gunslinger&#x27;s Wings</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+skill which allowed slower descent for you and, therefore, your follower. I used</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to fly people to places typically unreachable to their class for fun.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - Potential Item System</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Aka the system that broke the balance of Maplestory. Imagine picking up an item</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that suddenly increases your main stat by 20%. Or one that gives a slightly</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+weakened version of a class&#x27;s signature move e.g. Holy Symbol or Hyper Body</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+(increased health). It&#x27;s actually crazy that they added it, although I assume it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was a p2w move as it came with Cash Shop items for re-rolling potentials and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+whatnot.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2010 - BIG BANG</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Huge change. I don&#x27;t know where to start. It&#x27;s an entirely new game at this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+point. At least it did better than Maplestory 2!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2011 - Lion King&#x27;s Castle/Castle of Von Leon</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This was _the_ place to train when it was released. Mobs here were extremely</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+tough, required a few damage players to take down, and gave a ton of experience.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Couple that with experience bonuses for hunting in parties, and a 2x experience</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+event, people would be queuing up for these maps for hours. Fortunately, as a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Bishop, I could easily get into a party needing Holy Symbol and just needed to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+press it every couple of minutes or so to keep the buff up. Which reminds me of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+another client side mod that changed the range of HS to be map-wide rather than</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a small area around the character.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2011 - Gate to the Future/Boss: Empress</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Nothing much to say here, except brag again I was in one of the first successful</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+raids against this boss.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2011 - Player-vs-Player (PvP)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2011 - Capture the Flag</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I don&#x27;t remember which was which, but one funny thing was how unbalanced Bishops</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+were in PvP. Their main attack skill, Shining Ray, was aoe damage and stun. They</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+also had a skill called Doom which turned people into snails. I often got the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+hacker comment for using Doom, and, at this point, I wasn&#x27;t actually hacking as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+this account was &quot;important&quot; and I didn&#x27;t want to risk it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+### 2011 - Silent Crusade/Crusader Codex</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This is the last thing I remember doing on my main account, hunting down various</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+mobs and mini-bosses to collect their cards, as I was fully geared at this point</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and just hung around in towns or did basic things. I must have been locked out</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+sometime recently after this. I won&#x27;t really go into my return to the game as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it&#x27;s quite casual and uneventful.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+One memory that I&#x27;d like to bring up is how I attended my first (virtual)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+wedding in Maplestory. It was for my guild leader, who said he was a veteran,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and he bought a wedding ticket from the Cash Shop. I&#x27;m not sure who the virtual</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+girlfriend/wife was, or if they knew each other in real life. I do remember the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+guild leader spending a lot of in-game money for her, though. The wedding was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+fun, and there were random after-wedding events and rewards. I even gave them</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+some kind of wedding gift, but I&#x27;ve forgotten what it was.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Another memory would be the first time I killed the balrogs that sometimes</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+attack on the ship to Orbis, then inviting everyone outside because it was safe</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to come out.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And one where I finally hit max mesos on a character (it&#x27;s the 2^31 -1 number!)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Also one where I was able to reconnect with a friend months after not seeing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+them - he used to be a trusty damage dealer while I was a trusty support. He</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+disappeared for a bit, but then I ran into him in an area we first met at, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+we played together until I was banned. Hi, Boredsback if you&#x27;re reading this...</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+or was it Boredisback? I don&#x27;t remember.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+A classic one is me spending my Christmas decorating the in-game tree by</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+dropping items in front of it with some friends. My most coveted item may be a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+star that glows when dropped.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Dang, I wish I had _any_ record of my time back then. I would rate the game as</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+used to be good but, now, based on what I hear, it&#x27;s kind of whatever.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## dungeon fighter online</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## dungeon n fighter (KR)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;d say DFO wasn&#x27;t a game I try-harded much at, but instead one where I may have</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+contributed to the botting scheme that eventually crashed the game&#x27;s economy and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+killed the initial release. Yes, I played legitimately and had full sets of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+gears with special bonuses for Crusaders, but I mainly spent my time helping a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+few people mess with the game - it wasn&#x27;t too difficult as it was centered</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+around packet capture and editing.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There were some unique hacks, like using various consumables without actually</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+needing them, but the important hacks centered around three things: hitting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+things on screen for a maximum amount of damage, god-mode, and automatic</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+movement/looting; it was very straightforward, and bots could easily run through</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+dungeons and collect rewards. At the height (or lowest point) of the game, I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+could watch tens or hundreds of bots with gibberish names entering and exiting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+dungeons every few seconds. There used to be a fatigue system that limited how</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+much one could play or get rewarded per day, but that was removed, and the game</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+slowly died after.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+After it died, I was invited to play the Korean version, which required some</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+kind of Korean citizen identifier to register for. I was given an account to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+play with though, so I didn&#x27;t have to mess with that. I also remember having to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+use IE and downloading some kind of extension... My main in-game memory of that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+is not understanding any of the text, trying to speak to some random players in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+English, asking my friend to translate what they&#x27;re saying, and him telling me</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that everyone was calling me a Yankee. Hilarious!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Of course, there was a re-release of the game for the global audience, and I was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+pulled back into my old group. This time, I tried to play both sides; legitimate</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+icon and shady icon. I even hosted a legitimate PvP tournament early on... which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+one? The one where a community manager accidentally left his &quot;hit things on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+screen automatically&quot; hack on stream and was subsequently banned a bit later. If</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I remember correctly, the fact that he was a community manager wasn&#x27;t released</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+yet, but _another_ community manager leaked some Skype chats that showed proof.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Unfortunately it seems the drama has disappeared to the void because the website</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+didn&#x27;t allow crawling and the domain has been bought out.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;video controls src=&quot;/blobs/71/hacker.mp4&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Those are the hacks I worked on being demoed! Man, just seeing that UI I made</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for the tournament on the right brings back memories. It is a beautiful</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+monster - now that I&#x27;m looking at it, I instantly have ideas on how to improve</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it: center the names and mirror one of the portraits. I didn&#x27;t have much design</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+sense back then, as I only had to design menus. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I did</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+quite a poor job hosting the tournament as I remember having trouble just</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+keeping the graphics and bracket updated.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Part of this tournament was an impromptu fight between two of the top(?)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+American(?) players and a transfer student from Korea who happened to be a pro</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+player for the game because the caster disconnected. I found that funny because</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I remember someone just spamming a huge aoe to zone the Korean player and the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+other guy taking shots.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;video controls src=&quot;/blobs/71/teamwork.mp4&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+We quickly see how two people team up against one despite it being a free for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+all fight - very interesting! Sorry for the audio cutting out, I assume I&#x27;m</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+switching windows to talk with the caster. Full recordings of that tournament</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+exist, but you&#x27;ll have to find them yourself. They are from 2015, and, if you&#x27;re</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+wondering, the professional player (JungJam) won overall.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+But in the end, I didn&#x27;t have much interest in playing the game again, and this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+time it showed - I stopped having anything to do with it. Also, they kept the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+fatigue system up this time, which comes with pros and cons. I guess I used to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spend an over-average amount of time on games, so I would need more fatigue</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+points than the average player.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;d rate the game as very fun! But, like most games, devolves into an grueling</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+grind that is limited due to limited entries into endgame dungeons per day and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the fatigue system. PvP is also fun, but DFO PvP seems to be greatly impacted by</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+lag compared to PvP in other games.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## combat arms</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+And now a shooter. I seem to remember Combat Arms boasting a ton of weapons and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+modifications, but at the end of the day, there are only a few meta picks, so</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+no, I did not care for that. I took a little interest in the normal PvP game</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+modes like Search and Destroy and Elimination Pro, but spent most of my time on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the game modes Quarantine and Fireteam, reaching a decent rank with a solid 2.0+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+KD ratio. The rank was a vertical silver stripe.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Quarantine is the standard zombie mode, where a few players are infected and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+need to infect other players. Non-infected players either try to eliminate the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+infected or stay alive. There were several aspects to Quarantine that I really</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+enjoyed. First of all, some maps were huge and allowed hiding in very clever</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spots, my favorites being either under the bridge on Kill Creek or on the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+backside of a net that acts as a ladder in Two Towers. Hiding spots don&#x27;t always</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+have to be in corners, though. A classic hiding spot I had in Overdose was to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+just crouch against a wall by some props, and it had a quite high success rate.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There were more offensive strategies, and they typically involve explosives -</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the most effective weapons against infected. Setting 3 mines on a choke point</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+could instantly kill infected, and bringing LAWs, RPGs, and HE grenades could</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+greatly help destroy them in other scenarios. In Overdose, there were a couple</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of safe rooms that opened after a set amount of time which could allow for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+amazing setups while infected try to break in. If there is no safe room and I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+was discovered, I could typically try out-parkouring infected movement by</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+jumping around on obstacles.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Fireteam is a co-op game mode where players fight against NPCs. There were many,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+but the one I remember best is Cabin Fever, which is basic zombie wave survival.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+A few rounds in and there probably won&#x27;t be enough firepower to keep infected</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out of the cabin, and you end up having to run circles around the cabin while</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+they follow. I think I&#x27;ve only beaten it legitimately a few times, but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+illegitimately... many times, which brings me to the more unique hacks for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Combat Arms. All FPS games and shooters have a typical array of hacks, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+include things that modify weapons like no recoil or no spread, and hacks that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+give extra information like chams, esp, or wallhacks. Combat Arms had two unique</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+hacks which were dubbed OPK (one position kill) and telekill (teleport kill).</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+What they did is teleport you to an enemy, or an enemy to you, so you could</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+attack forward, typically with a melee weapon, and hit them. Naturally, this</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+kind of hack made Fireteam missions easy (and could make any PvP game mode easy,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+but I didn&#x27;t use them there... usually). These things could be combined with a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+client side mod that changed the fire rate of weapons (including melee) for very</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+quick kills.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Another interesting thing is that the weapons could only be purchased for fixed</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+periods of time. Maybe I should say rented. I did end up spending some money on</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a permanent K5SD though... not sure I leveraged it much. I enjoyed the game, but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I think the movement and gameplay was a little slow and clunky.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## crossfire</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Another shooter? This one is unique in that it is the only MMO that I played</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with a friend that I knew in real life. Like Combat Arms, I was mainly a fan of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+its unique game modes like Mutation Mode and Ghost Mode.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Ghost Mode consists of semi-invisible melee only players attempting to plant a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+bomb and normal players trying to prevent the bomb or defuse it after its</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+planted. Being a ghost was definitely a lot funner as it had some nice skill</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+caps around movement - moving is supposed to be revealing, but a combination of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+jumping, crouching, and strafing, could allow one to move almost as efficiently</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+as running while remaining fully stealthed. It could only be done backwards, but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+you could turn around mid jumps to see where you were going. The other counter</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to ghosts was being heard breathing, but the technique to avoid this is to not</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spend much time by normal players - just drive-by melee them. Arguably a good</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ghost was very hard to defeat. I played it so much that I literally had numerous</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+specific techniques and tactics that I would use in most games. On the other</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+hand, as a normal player, you get ranged weaponry - camping in hard to reach</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+areas and spraying in the direction of breathing noises is about as good as it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+got at high levels. Or maybe catch a glimpse of a ghost? Or just have hacks to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+show where ghosts are... I may have made and used something like that a few</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+times.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Mutation Mode is the zombie mode. There are two approaches for this game&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+version; hide or defend. But there were also various interesting glitches that I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+used to get to interesting spots. First of all, it was possible to clip into</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+geometry by quickly running forward and backwards on top of a corner. This could</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+be done in a lot of areas, but eventually was patched out and would crash the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+client with an error if detected. Or you would enter a killbox. The other thing</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I liked to do was &quot;fly&quot; with my friend. It involved clipping two characters</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+together and jumping at the same time. As long as no one moved and jumping was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+done properly, we would slowly ascend into the air - we could either camp in mid</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+air or drop down onto some geometry that isn&#x27;t meant to be reached. That was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+fun.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I had many accounts for some reason... I think I was testing out hacks on them.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+But the highest ranked one was also a silver stripe, like in Combat Arms. I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a coincidence or if I did it intentionally. It was a fun</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+game with not many downsides.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+There are a few other fps games, but I don&#x27;t really have much to say about them</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+except that I spent a lot of time playing and hacking them: GunZ: The Duel,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Alliance of Valiant Arms, Battlefield Heroes, and Battlefield Play4Free.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## league of legends</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Of course I played this. It was the cool thing at the time. And it seems to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+still be the cool thing, although you have to complain about it, too.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Hmm, how can I explain my time on the game - all I can say is I hit level 30,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+then started playing ranked games, eventually hitting 2.1k elo - this was back</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+when they had the elo system instead of tiers. Ah, now that I think about it I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+used to level and sell accounts on this game. God, it&#x27;s interesting to realize</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that I don&#x27;t have many memories of this game except that I spent a _ton_ of time</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+on it.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Oh, also I remember I had the opportunity to give feedback on the game once, and</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I said something like &quot;stop adding so many champions because only a few will</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+matter while the rest just sit there!&quot;... I see the game now and I don&#x27;t even</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+recognize half of them.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, I&#x27;m sure the game is still good considering its popularity. I&#x27;ll do a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+little aside for DOTA 2, too as I played that casually with friends. Back then,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I would say League of Legends was a lot simpler and streamlined compared to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+DOTA 2. There are mechanics like blocking creeps, disjointing projectiles, turn</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+speed, micro, and more that you just didn&#x27;t find in League of Legends that were</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+present in DOTA 2. But yes, both are fun in their own capacity.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## path of exile</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I don&#x27;t know how I got into this game, but I enjoyed it. I think I played</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+between the Domination and Ambush leagues, but stopped playing after that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+because... grindfest. I did have my Righteous Fire level 100 character by then</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+and hundreds of exalts so I felt like the game was basically completed for me.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I did get back into the game for Delve and Betrayal, but felt like it was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+getting to be pretty complex. Do games without sequels just get too complex</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+after a certain point in time? Am I getting _old_?</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## tera</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Ah TERA, I actually [wrote about it](/posts/52) recently because it shut down. I</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+never truly hit endgame, as the grind is stupid long (random chance upgrades,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+limited dungeon entries, content constantly being scaled), but I enjoyed the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+game because I had a consistent friend to play with.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+## warframe</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+How about a third (person) shooter? I started playing Warframe on the suggestion</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+of the same friend who got me into Guild Wars 2! However, this time there were</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+other people playing the game with us, but that didn&#x27;t stop me from quitting the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+game - the game was unique in terms of movement, but really was a grindfest; we</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+would try to grind endless void missions for prime blueprints.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Well, I came back a bit later by myself and started playing the game regularly:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I went super meta and started helping with the drop table data mining as it was</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+important for my try-hardiness. I was able to become pretty good at the game, or</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at least find extremely efficient playstyles - kill everything before they can</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+kill you - and basically rolled the game, achieving basically everything</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+important to achieve. Here&#x27;s are some random youtube playlists of videos I took;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+by this time I knew it would be a good idea to start recording things!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- PLFcNSaFKsff(sex)-IuJiCg(i)\_ihl_GMf(nein)M9VA</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- PLFcNSaFKsff(svn)d(tree)wcpkzuvE96(tres)pogEGHJ(ate)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+- PLFcNSaFKsff(for)nNOzhwVFHpU(zed)\_hptVSm(sox)j</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Yep, just random gameplay videos and nothing too specific. What is interesting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+is how our little data mining team slowly turned into reverse engineering the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+client, and this &quot;little&quot; reverse engineering allowed us to stand up our own</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+private Warframe server (written in PHP no less!) Most of the actual game is in</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the client and the server was mainly like a database back then; it was fun to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+figure out how to patch the client so it would talk to our server instead. This</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+also led to some more questionable actions, as we also figured out how to reward</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+ourselves with whatever we wanted and saving the results _to the official</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+servers_. When this happened, the figurehead quickly rounded up a few select</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+people to continue doing this, and other people, including myself, were out.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+That didn&#x27;t stop Digital Extremes from sending a cease and desist to us, well</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the figurehead, and stuff happened, but I was not privy to the matter by that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+point.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Oh, I also got banned once for hacking, but was able to revert it as support</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+told me everyone has one freebie, well I guess I won&#x27;t stretch my luck anymore!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+What I enjoyed about the game was the set of unique weapons and mods. I would</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+spend tons of time trying out new combinations to maximize my damage, and came</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+across some off-meta choices that were pretty good, or at least until the big</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+weapon changes that came with a patch. The build was this:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Primary - Mutalist Quanta Alternate Fire Spam</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - Combined with Bursting Mass and focusing damage on the alternate fire,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      this ends up being a huge aoe spamming weapon with no self damage. Quite</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      convenient for just hitting things in a large area.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Secondary - Twin Kohmak</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - An extremely overlooked secondary, basically a crazy but ammo inefficient</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      bullet hose.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Melee - Plague Kripath</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - A pretty standard melee build, as I just used melee most of the time.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+4. Frame - Nekros Prime</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    - The frame doesn&#x27;t really matter, as I did not need survivability or damage</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      boosts, so I used Nekros for the unique passive extra loot utility.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+These ranged weapons also benefit from a high Riven disposition, which I took</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+advantage of. Eventually the game does get repetitive and grindy, though. I quit</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a little before the release of the Orphix Venom event, as the game really</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+started to lose a sense of direction - there was a lot of content, but it all</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+turned out to be very shallow. I did have basically everything that could be had</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+up to and including Railjacks, but after that it felt like an endless race for</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+completionists like me. Steam says I have 3k hours, and I feel like the in-game</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+timer would say around 2k hours in missions. BUT surprise! I&#x27;m installing it</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+right now (or have already installed it), let&#x27;s see if my Framework can handle</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+it; I hope there&#x27;s not too much new stuff to get into.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Some of these games still exist, and some of my accounts do, too. It&#x27;s crazy to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+calculate how much time I&#x27;ve spent messing around on games... It&#x27;s probably over</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+a tenth of my current life, and definitely is if we factor in the non-MMO games!</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+So I did get to check Warframe out a bit before submitting this post, and let&#x27;s</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+take a look at some quick screenshots that I took as I renewed myself with it:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+![daily reward](/blobs/71/daily.png)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+My first daily reward when I come back after a couple years seems to be a 75%</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+percent off platinum coupon! These are somewhat rare, as I only remember getting</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+maybe 2 in my years of playing, so I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence or not.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+In fact, the first one I got was extremely early on when I started playing the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+game, and the last one I got was very near the time I quit the game. Is time a</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+flat circle? Am I starting to play the game again? And here are my general</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+stats:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+![playtime summary](/blobs/71/summary.png)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2k hours was close and the statistics are nice enough to convert that into days</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+for us... 79 days! And around 14 hours spent on solving ciphers (a small puzzle</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+that&#x27;s part of the game mechanics for unlocking doors); crazy! I see they&#x27;ve</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+added some new areas since I&#x27;ve gone, as my star chart progress is not maxed</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out. I was also assaulted by around 10 new messages for events that occurred</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+during the time I was out - a lot of things changed so here&#x27;s some kind of</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+refund - and ended up with a round a week of free boosters. There does seem to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+be a decent amount of new content - at least 3 quest lines. After a little</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+looking around the game, I came across this:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+![ui glitch](/blobs/71/glitched.png)</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Uh yeah the game glitched so I had to shut it off. Overall, it does seem like my</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+low spec laptop can handle it which is interesting because the graphics don&#x27;t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+seem too outdated in my opinion. This may be the game I&#x27;ll be playing in the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+near future!</span>
