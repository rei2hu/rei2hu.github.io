<h1 id=debugging-a-git-push-422-response>debugging a git push 422 response</h1>
<p>If you're receiving a 422 response when interacting with the remote repository AND you are not messing with large files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check what version of <code>git</code> you're using</li>
<li>If using an old version, check the requests being made with
<code>GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push</code></li>
<li>If any redirects are being made, change your remote url to what the redirect is OR use an updated version of <code>git</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We're wrapping up our first project in grad school and someone shared that they were having trouble using <code>git</code> on the remote server when pushing. They were receiving the error:</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-93-1 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-93-1></label><code>Counting objects: 14, <span class=hljs-keyword>done</span>.
Delta compression using up to 16 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), <span class=hljs-keyword>done</span>.
Writing objects: 100% (12/12), 1.16 KiB | 0 bytes/s, <span class=hljs-keyword>done</span>.
Total 12 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 422
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>
<p>and shared this on the class forum. This is not one of the usual errors that occur when using <code>git</code> so it took a little bit of effort to find the issue. The first thing I asked was for them to try
<code>GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git push</code> for more info, and to share the redacted output. I compared it with the output of my command, which worked, and noticed a difference in output</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-93-2 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-93-2></label><code><span class=hljs-addition>+ git remote-https origin https://domain/user/repo</span>
<span class=hljs-deletion>- git remote-https origin https://domain/user/repo.git</span>
</code></pre>
<p>They were missing the ".git" suffix on their url. Is this an issue? Not necessarily because the logs showed redirects which should have allowed <code>git</code> to push to the "proper" url.</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-93-3 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-93-3></label><code>&lt; HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
&lt; Location: https://domain/user/repo.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I updated my own remote url with <code>git remote set-url</code>, I was able to reproduce the issue. At this point I shared the workaround of updating the remote url to include ".git" and that worked for them.</p>
<p>But then I wondered how did their remote get set to the url without ".git" initially - it suggests that they were able to clone without that suffix, which should have resulted in the same 422 response. I then tried various operations locally using a remote url without the ".git" suffix and they worked without issue.</p>
<p>I eventually realized that the ~default~ <code>git</code> binary on the server was
<code>1.8.3.1</code> while my local version was a much more recent <code>2.38.1.windows.1</code>, so I went out and installed a version I could find that was around the server's:
<code>1.8.4</code>. Unfortunately when trying to clone something with this version, I ran into the error</p>
<pre class=code-block><input id=code-block-93-4 type=checkbox><label for=code-block-93-4></label><code>error:1407742E:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert protocol version
</code></pre>
<p>which I was able to get around by rebuilding with an updated version of curl, and the issue was reproduced. So it looks like trying to use redirects was an issue in older versions of <code>git</code>. This still doesn't answer the question of how they cloned the repository without the ".git" suffix on the server, but after looking over the project setup instructions, I realized there was a way to load a newer <code>git</code> binary (version 2.19.0).</p>
<p>So I believe what happened was:</p>
<ol>
<li>SSH into server</li>
<li>Follow instructions, load git 2.19.0 and clone without ".git" suffix</li>
<li>Time passes</li>
<li>SSH into server again</li>
<li>Forget to load git 2.19.0 and push, resulting in the error</li>
</ol>
<p>And what do you know, on the weekend of the deadline, several other students shared similar issues and the <code>git remote set-url</code> solution solved their problems, too.</p>
