<h1 id=framework-gaming-and-baldurs-gate-3>framework gaming and baldur's gate 3</h1>
<p>I just finished my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 and thought I'd leave a couple of thoughts about the game. This will cover random topics including performance because I run a relatively low-powered setup: a Framework Laptop 13 with a 12th Gen Intel i5-1240P which comes with Intel Iris Xe Graphics. I knew getting this laptop was a risk to gaming ability but decided to get it anyways based on reviews/marketing saying that the integrated graphics was decent for gaming. As you can guess, I was able to play through Baldur's Gate 3 with this card, although not without issues. Foreword: I enjoyed the game though all I will do is point out issues.</p>
<p>Originally I planned to play through the game with a couple of friends, and we were playing it a few hours every day religiously. Unfortunately a disagreement by the other players over a dialogue option led to a stopping of that - when dialogue is forced upon the party as a scripted event, the nearest character gets to make the choices; the evil paladin ended up picking the "side with evil and slaughter everyone" option, in line with his character, which the ranger kleptomaniac did not agree with, and we restarted that fight several times with the good dialogue option. The kicker is that we could not with the good fight and ended up going with the evil option anyways. I'd estimate we were around 60% through Act 1. Either way, we stopped playing regularly so I started a singleplayer campaign which took around 70 hours to complete (but more due to reloads) following a relatively heroic path and doing most of the quests. I</p>
<p>Act 1 is optimized quite well; I was very concerned that my laptop could not handle the game but using the lowest quality settings and one of the lowest available resolutions: 1024x768, the game was able to run at around 15-20 fps (and at a toasty 90c), which is playable for a turn based rpg. Unfortunately, the game's interface is not designed for this resolution (or any 4:3 resolution for that matter) and is cut off, causing a few problems. The story at this point is very relatively straightforward and I didn't run into too many continuity issues, as things are gated by combat ability, and it would be too difficult to be overleveled at this point.</p>
<p>Act 2 is where problems started appearing. Immediately after entering one of the main areas of this act, my frames started tanking and I thought finishing the game would be unbearable due to this issue. Fortunately, I came across a fix: tactical camera (default key: o). For one reason or another, this seems to remove the particle effects and also lower the texture quality more which served me well throughout the rest of the game (though not always). Tactical camera also makes the game more difficult to play due to the top-down view sometimes hiding range indicators, or making you click on higher floors, and in general making it difficult to transition between indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>This act is also where the quests start getting convoluted; it's very likely you will explore many areas before receiving the quest to actually do so, making you miss out on various pieces of content. These problems, gameplay and performance, are only exacerbated in Act 3, where you probably hit the level cap around a quarter of the way in if you explored enough in the earlier 2 acts.</p>
<p>And then there is also the final gauntlet of fights, where everything can turn truly terrible. The performance is abysmal, and even worse considering that I've been playing for a bit to get to this point. In fact, if the performance is bad enough, characters' apparel don't even load in so many of them appear naked (including naked Withers!) it game and also in cutscenes, including the final ones. Also playing at the lowest quality settings makes it extremely hard to see certain area of effect markers which can lead to a quick death in a portion of this gauntlet.</p>
<p>I also think the tactician AI takes a long time to think of moves for enemies which makes fights with a lot of them a waitfest. Compared to the AI in Divinity: Original Sin 2, it seems like BG3 AI is much less creative but takes the same amount or longer time to think of moves.</p>
<p>Another common issue that occurred would be lingering AOEs after fights that lasted into, interrupted, or even fully prevent cutscenes - a large one is silence which prevents most spells from being cast and is quite useful in combat, but will also prevent many important quest related cutscenes/dialogue from triggering if relevant characters are silenced. Even removing silence afterwards will not trigger these events. Furthermore, it is possible that a character will walk into a lingering damage field during a cutscene, thinking you've attacked them, and initiating combat. Fortunately there is non-lethal mode so you can just knock them out and they do seem to trigger cutscenes after doing so (though they're supposed to be knocked out.)</p>
<p>Also, while the story was good, the need to long rest (sometimes in certain areas) to progress quests or unlock certain parts of the story is pretty unreasonable as you can miss out on things if you don't long rest enough but can also miss out on things if you long rest too much. don't think I long rested at all during the first act, which lead to a ton of cutscenes before the transition to act 2 and dumped a lot of plot points at once. It would be nicer if you could just go to camp and trigger cutscenes manually.</p>
<p>Overall, all things considered, I enjoyed the game. I don't consider graphics very highly when rating a game, and the story and gameplay are good. The fact that I can even play this game says something about either the performance or the integrated graphics card I have. I also believe there is still a solid amount of content to play through with an evil playthrough.</p>
