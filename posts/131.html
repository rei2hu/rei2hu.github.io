Javascript is necessary for displaying LaTeX, some demos that run algorithms directly on the page, and small cosmetic features like light/dark mode.

<p>Recently, there was a bug where data was being labeled with a "cannot fetch information" message at the place where I work at. No one was sure if this was an issue on our end or another company's end because we were fetching information from an external api and tacking that information on.</p>
<p>It was assigned to one person previously, who found out that the message came from our code and said it's because the external api may not return some specific pieces of information under certain cases (e.g. nullable or optional fields) so that message pops up, but did no further investigation.</p>
<p>I ended up picking this task up and continued the work by pulling credentials from the database, manually making calls to the external api, and looking at the response - alright, the fields don't exist (as expected because that's why the code followed that specific path).</p>
<p>I then looked up the official documentation for the external api that describes the possible fields in the response for the specific endpoint we're working with and found out that the fields our code was looking for were not mentioned in the documentation. Perhaps they made a kind of breaking change and removed the fields we were previously looking at?</p>
<p>The official documentation actually included a relatively comprehensive section about versioning and supposed guarantees about keeping backwards compatibility which included the mention of not removing any fields unless there was a major version change; their versioning followed semver (semantic versioning) and was still on 0.x.y, so it seemed impossible that the major version could have ever changed.</p>
<p>Finally, I looked at the blame for the classes in our code that described the response objects, and found the original pull request that introduced them. One year ago, the dev that made those classes left a comment on how the classes were generated by copilot by feeding the official documentation into it and was a great time-save. Right, it saved time and generated inaccurate code. To be frank, the classes are like 400 lines of simple property only classes so it would've been "boring" to write.</p>
<p>Anyways, coming across something like that is what really makes me lose faith in professional software engineers. Why?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>AI was used and the output was not checked thoroughly. AI was used for a simple case, got things wrong, and it wasn't caught by the original dev nor the two reviewers (though, as a reviewer but not one of the two reviewers on the introductory pull request, I would not have verified the entire classes in depth with the official documentation because that's basically doing the actual workâ€¦)</p></li>
<li><p>Code that never worked was deployed to prod. Sometimes it's hard to check if a feature works before deploying to prod, but this was not one of those times; there was enough test data in the development environment, and the company that provided the api also provided a sandbox environment to aid with testing things on their side.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, I think the bar for technical skill/craftsmanship is a lot lower in the professional world (after the interview, of course). Obviously everyone has different bars so opinions may vary, but mine definitely include making sure the code you write (or generate with AI) works.</p>
<p>Though I haven't used AI generated code in either professional or hobby development yet.</p>
