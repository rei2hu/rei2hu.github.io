<h1 id=electron-memory-usage>electron memory usage</h1>
<p>I decided to try out Electron to build an app. One common concern around Electron is its resource usage so I attempted to keep track of it. I set up their <a href=https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start>quick-start</a> app and noted took a look at what the memory usage is like:</p>
<p><img alt=quickstart-app-mem src=/blobs/32/quickstart-app-mem.png></p>
<p>Around 60mb - arguably good by today's app standards but definitely much higher than something hand rolled.</p>
<p>I planned to display some visuals about application usage for this app so I had to hook into the windows api with an addon. Once I wrote that along with some a very simple pie chart, I decided to take a look at the memory again:</p>
<p><img alt=fake-app-mem src=/blobs/32/fake-app-mem.png></p>
<p>Wow! Did it really just jump 20-30mb because of my addon? You may note that there is a <code>(5)</code> in this screenshot when previously there was a <code>(4)</code>. This is where all the extra memory was being used. Initially I thought it was my addon as it ran its own thread to hook into windows eventsâ€¦ but it wasn't.</p>
<p>It was DevTools.</p>
<p>I added a line to open up DevTools to help debugging when I ran the app and that is what the new sub-process was. It turns out that not opening DevTools gave me a much nicer number.</p>
<p><img alt=true-app-mem src=/blobs/32/true-app-mem.png></p>
<p>The great thing is you can see this behavior in any Electron app. We can observe similar behavior with Discord's app.</p>
<p><img alt=discord-mem src=/blobs/32/discord-mem.png></p>
<p>Why was it +80mb this time? Who knows - maybe they do a lot of stuff with it. Really, I should be taking the average increase over several opens. Frankly speaking, the extreme memory usage really dissuades me from using it to develop my own apps. I think I'm done with this project and I'll just share the addon by itself without the Electron component.</p>
