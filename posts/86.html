<p>* across a bajillion users.</p>
<p>I was recently reading the article
<a href=https://blog.chromium.org/2023/11/how-core-web-vitals-saved-users-10000.html>How Core Web Vitals saved users 10,000 years of waiting for web pages to load</a>
this year and I realized that I'm not really a fan of total time saved across all users as a metric. This is not a jab at the Chrome team specifically, but in general, but I'll be using this as an example.</p>
<p>10.000 years of time is a great number, but what's the impact for individual users? Well that translates into around 315.576.000.000 seconds, and there are estimates up to
<a href=https://atlasvpn.com/blog/more-than-3-billion-internet-users-now-use-the-google-chrome-browser>3.3 billion</a>
users as of 2021. To be generous, I'll say there are only 1 billion users, so the time saved per person is a lot higher. This translates to, on average, 315 seconds or 5 minutes saved per user per year.</p>
<p>Of course, there are both heavy and light users of the browser, so I'd be fine saying something like a heavy user saves 100x of the time a normal user saves, so 500 minutes a year. However, the savings of a heavy user should be spread somewhat evenly over the year because they're constantly using and saving time, so they save like 2 minutes a day. What is someone going to do with 2 extra minutes in their day? And I think I've been pretty generous with the numbers so in reality it's much less than 2 minutes for most people.</p>
<p>I just don't find it fair to aggregate on time for some reason. Choosing another statistic like electricity saved or something else would be much better. I'm not sure why I have qualms with time though, perhaps it's because it only goes forward and one person's time is so different from another person's that I don't think they should be combined. Using aggregate time is some kind of embellishment technique to look good in my opinion.</p>
<p>I don't mean to dunk on anyone's work that uses this metric to communicate success, but rather the presentation itself.</p>
