<p>Not sure what to observe here…</p>
<p>(b) Prove that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then for every pair $(j, k)$ with $0 \leq j \lt p$ and $0 \leq k \lt q$, there is a unique integer $0 \leq i \lt pq$ such that $i \equiv j \text{ mod } p$ and $i \equiv k \text{ mod } q$.</p>
<p>So to relate this back to (a) first, the table does look like an example of this $p = 3$ and $q = 5$. Each pair of $(x \text{ mod } 3, x \text{ mod } 5)$ is unique and maps to a number between $0 \le i \lt pq$.</p>
<p>This is a hand wavey explanation that I thought of, but basically they don't need to be distinct primes, just relatively prime. Because the result of the modulus operator cycles from $0$ to $n-1$ repeatedly, the only time a duplicate pair would show in the table would be at the lcm. I think. Because the lcm of two primes $p$ and $q$ is $pq$, there will be no duplicate pairs in the range $[0..pq)$. A quick supporting example would be for $x \text{ mod } 4$ and $x \text{ mod } 6$ should have it's first duplicate at 12, which is the lcm of 4 and 6.</p>
<p>Maybe will try mathematical approach later. Hope explanation is at least valid.</p>
<h2 id=question-2>Question 2</h2>
<p>Alice and her three friends are all users of the RSA cryptosystem. Her friends have public keys $(N_i, e_i = 3)$, $i = 1, 2, 3$, where as always, $N_i = p_iq_i$ for randomly chosen n-bit primes $p_i$, $q_i$. Show that if Alice sends the same n-bit message $M$ (encrypted using RSA) to each of her friends, then anyone who intercepts all three encrypted messages will be able to efficiently recover $M$.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is recall the steps of RSA and how they work.</p>
<p>To generate keys:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate 2 random primes $p$ and $q$</li>
<li>Pick an $e$ that is relatively prime to $(p - 1)(q - 1)$, and let $N = pq$</li>
<li>Let the public key be $(N, e)$</li>
<li>The private key is $d = e^{-1} \text{ mod } (p - 1)(q - 1)$</li>
</ol>
<p>For encryption/decryption:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encryption: compute $y = m^e \text{ mod } N$ where $m$ is the message and $y$ is the encrypted message</li>
<li>Decryption: compute $m = y^d \text{ mod } N$</li>
</ol>
<p>The encrypted message $M_i$ will be $M^3 \text{ mod } N_i$ for each of her friends. This means we can solve the system $M^3 = M_i \text{ mod } N_i$. According to chinese remainder theorem, we can get a solution by following the steps.</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} N &= (\prod_{i=1}^{3} N_i) \\ a_i &= M_i \\ y_i &= N / N_i \\ z_i &= y_i^{-1} \text{ mod } N_i \\ M^3 &= \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_iy_iz_i \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, I still don't fully get the theorem so I will be revisiting this… Thought for a couple minutes and I think I kind of get it, consider the normal formulation:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} x &\equiv a_1 \text{ mod } n_1 \\ x &\equiv a_2 \text{ mod } n_2 \\ x &\equiv a_k \text{ mod } n_k \\ \end{align} $$ $a_iy_iz_i$ is divisible by $n_j$ if $j \neq i$ because $y_i$ includes $n_j$. This means $(\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_iy_iz_i) \text{ mod } n_i$ turns into $(a_iy_iz_i) \text{ mod } n_i$ which then turns into $a_i$ because $y_i$ and $z_i$ are inverses. Then we want to get a unique number so we use $\mod { N }$. Easy to think backwards, but I wonder how the theorem was originally conceived - well that seems to be an overarching theme in math for me.</p>
<p>I'll still revisit because I like to be at a place where I can derive the formulas myself with a few insights because there is less memorization needed and that's how I've approached all technical topics so far.</p>
<p>Here is one way that chinese remainder theorem might have been derived from a concrete example. Start with the first equivalence:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} x &\equiv a_1 \text{ mod } n_1 \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>A valid solution for $x$ would be $a_1$.</p>
<p>Now what if we want to bring in another equivalence?</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} x &\equiv a_1 \text{ mod } n_1 \\ x &\equiv a_2 \text{ mod } n_2 \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>We do the same thing as before but for the second one and get $a_2$. However, we somehow want to combine the two equations into one. We know that $a \text{ mod } b$ has solutions of the form $bk + a$ where $k$ is anything, so why don't we start out by trying to add them together?</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} (a_1) + (a_2) \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>What we want now is for all of these parenthesized groups to disappear when we do $\text{ mod } n_i$ except for the one for that $i$. This is possible by multiplying each group by the product of the other $n$s. But first, let's expand to three equivalences just for show (it's not as enlightening with only two):</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} (a_1) + (a_2) + (a_3) \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>If I want $a_1$ to be divisible by $n_2$, multiply it by $n_2$. Same for $n_3$. In short, multiply each group by the product of the other moduli:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} (n_2n_3)(a_1) + (n_1n_3)(a_2) + (n_1n_2)(a_3) \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>Now, when we take that equation and do $\text{ mod } n_i$ ($i=1$ for example), we end with:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} & (n_2n_3)(a_1) + (n_1n_3)(a_2) + (n_1n_2)(a_3) &\text{ mod } n_1 \\ & (n_2n_3)(a_1) &\text{ mod } n_1 \\ & (a_1n_2n_3) &\text{ mod } n_1 \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>All the terms we didn't want fell away! (A short aside, I feel like I've seen this "pattern" in a lot of places before when doing math stuff.)</p>
<p>At this point, we need to somehow get rid of $n_2n_3$. This is where we can take advantage of the fact that the moduli are relatively prime. We know $n_2n_3$ is relatively prime to $n_1$ because of this. Therefore, the inverse to $n_2n_3$ exists. Which we can use to obtain $a_1$ again. This means that for each parenthesized group, we should multiply it by the inverse of that product that we created. For example</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} ((n_2n_3)^{-1} \text{ mod } n_1)(n_2n_3)(a_1) + ((n_1n_3)^{-1} \text{ mod } n_2)(n_1n_3)(a_2) + ((n_1n_2)^{-1} \text{ mod } n_3)(n_1n_2)(a_3) \\ \end{align} $$</p>
<p>Look familiar? This is literally the theorem but a bit rearranged.</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} z_1y_1a_1 + z_2y_2a_2 + z_3y_3a_3 \end{align} $$</p>

<span class=hljs-addition>+all three encrypted messages will be able to efficiently recover $M$.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The first thing to do is recall the steps of RSA and how they work.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+To generate keys:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Generate 2 random primes $p$ and $q$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Pick an $e$ that is relatively prime to $(p - 1)(q - 1)$, and let $N = pq$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+3. Let the public key be $(N, e)$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+4. The private key is $d = e^{-1} \text{ mod } (p - 1)(q - 1)$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+For encryption/decryption:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. Encryption: compute $y = m^e \text{ mod } N$ where $m$ is the message and $y$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+   is the encrypted message</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+2. Decryption: compute $m = y^d \text{ mod } N$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The encrypted message $M_i$ will be $M^3 \text{ mod } N_i$ for each of her friends.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This means we can solve the system $M^3 = M_i \text{ mod } N_i$. According to chinese</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+remainder theorem, we can get a solution by following the steps.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+\begin{align}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    N &amp;= (\prod_{i=1}^{3} N_i) \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    a_i &amp;= M_i \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    y_i &amp;= N / N_i \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    z_i &amp;= y_i^{-1} \text{ mod } N \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    M^3 &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{3} a_iy_iz_i \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+\end{align}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Honestly speaking, I still don&#x27;t fully get the theorem so I will be revisiting this...</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Thought for a couple minutes and I think I kind of get it, consider the normal formulation:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+\begin{align}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    x &amp;\equiv a_1 \text{ mod } n_1 \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    x &amp;\equiv a_2 \text{ mod } n_2 \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    x &amp;\equiv a_k \text{ mod } n_k \\</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+\end{align}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$a_iy_iz_i$ is divisible by $n_j$ if $j \neq i$ because $y_i$ includes $n_j$. This</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+means $(\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_iy_iz_i) \text{ mod } n_i$ turns into</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$(a_iy_iz_i) \text{ mod } n_i$ which then turns into $a_i$ because $y_i$ and $z_i$</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+are inverses. Then we want to get a unique number so we use $\mod { N }$. Easy to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+think backwards, but I wonder how the theorem was originally conceived - well that</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+seems to be an overarching theme in math for me.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;ll still revisit because I like to be at a place where I can derive the formulas</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+myself with a few insights because there is less memorization needed and that&#x27;s how</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+I&#x27;ve approached all technical topics so far.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;/p&gt;</span>
