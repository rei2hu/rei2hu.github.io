<h2 id=question-1>Question 1</h2>
<p>
A certain string-processing language offers a primitive operation which splits a string into two pieces. Since this operation involves copying the original string, it takes $n$ units of time for a string of length $n$, regardless of the location of the cut. Suppose, now, that you want to break a string into many pieces. The order in which the breaks are made can affect the total running time. For example, if you want to cut a 20-character string at positions 3 and 10, then making the first cut at position 3 incurs a total cost of 20 + 17 = 37, while doing position 10 first has a better cost of 20 + 10 = 30.
<br>
<br>
Give a dynamic programming algorithm that, given the locations of $m$ cuts in a string of length $n$, finds the minimum cost of breaking the string into $m + 1$ pieces.
<br>
<br>
So, I can't think of a formula off the top of my head, and I'm not fully sure how the tree (I assume it's a tree approach) will look. However, let's try working the problem backwards; we have $m + 1$ substrings in order and we want to join them together while minimizing this cost. The cost to join 2 substrings $m_i$ and $m_{i + 1}$ is $\text{len}(m_i) + \text{len}(m_{i + 1})$. In this scenario, the cut locations are baked into the lengths of the substrings. Let's try it out on the example:
<br>
<br>
We have substrings of length 3, 7, and 10 because we have cuts at 3 and 10 and a total length of 20. It looks something like this:
<br>
<br>
<noscript><pre>
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node (a) {3};
    \node [right of = a] (b) {7};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</pre></noscript><script type=text/tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node (a) {3};
    \node [right of = a] (b) {7};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br>
And we are looking for a way to join them. It is important to note that only neighboring nodes can be joined. We have two choices at this moment:
<br>
<br>
<noscript><pre>
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {10}
      child{ node (a) {3} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</pre></noscript><script type=text/tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {10}
      child{ node (a) {3} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br>
<br>
<noscript><pre>
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {17}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (c) {10} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [left of = b] (a) {3};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</pre></noscript><script type=text/tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {17}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (c) {10} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [left of = b] (a) {3};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br>
We can also see various base cases here - when there is only 1 substring. However, one thing to note is that we also need to keep track of the total cost to reach that stage. If we were to go one step higher and reach 20, we realize that 20 is not the cost but rather the cost of the last step. Let's see the example but we also keep track of the cost:
<br>
<br>
<noscript><pre>
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {(20, 30)}
      child{node {(10, 10)}
        child{ node {(3, 0)} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
        child{ node {(7, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}}
        edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}
      }
      child{node {(10, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</pre></noscript><script type=text/tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {(20, 30)}
      child{node {(10, 10)}
        child{ node {(3, 0)} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
        child{ node {(7, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}}
        edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}
      }
      child{node {(10, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br>
Huh, weird size but whatever, it gets the idea across. Now this is where things get a little crazy. And where I had to do some manual testing to figure it out. Let's try putting together a table:
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>i\j</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>7</th>
<th>10</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>(3, 0)</td>
<td>(10, 10)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td></td>
<td>(7, 0)</td>
<td>(17, 17)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>(10, 0)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The weird thing is how to actually calculate what goes in the cells. How do I calculate the corner? Well, first, just to be explicit, we "add" tuples with the following function:</p>
<p>$$ \begin{align} add(a, b) = (a[0] + b[0], a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1]) \end{align} $$</p>
<p>Let's think back to our two trees above. We can either do $add((3, 0), (17, 17)) = (20, 37)$ or $add((10, 10), (10, 0)) = (20, 20)$ which is the solution. This might be obvious with the tree, and we might glance over it in the case of two cuts, but we need to dig deeper in the case of more cuts.
<br> <br> Let's try cuts at 4, 6, and 9 on a string of length 15. <br>
<br> Ok, so as usual, this leaves us with the consecutive segments: 4, 2, 3, 6. Our table looks like this after filling all the way to the 3rd diagonal:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>i\j</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>6</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>(4, 0)</td>
<td>(6, 6)</td>
<td>(9, 14)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td></td>
<td>(2, 0)</td>
<td>(5, 5)</td>
<td>(11, 16)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>(3, 0)</td>
<td>(9, 9)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>(6, 0)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
But what possibilities do we have for the corner now? Again, think back to the tree. Or really, the base nodes. Let me just define $f(i, j)$ to be the entry in the table, so we can avoid getting mixed up with the tuples. The equations we can use are $add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$, $add(f(4, 4), f(2, 6))$, and $add(f(4, 2), f(3, 6))$. The minimum turns out to be $add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$ which is $(15, 29)$. The minimum cost is 29.
<br>
<br>
Again, how did we figure out what we could add? Well we thought about the tree, but chances are our program won't have the luxury of looking at a tree (or we don't want to waste time writing something like that). You probably just need to stare at the table and draw some lines, as that's what I did, to find the pattern. Here is a nice image:
</p>
<p><img alt=dptable src=/blobs/4/dptable.png></p>
<p>
What you should notice is that for cells on the red diagonal, we calculated the value using cells that were a total of 2 units away from our target cell. For the blue diagonal, we considered cells that were a total of 3 units away, and for the green 4. With this, we now have a way to figure out what cells to use when calculating.
<br>
<br>
This problem's solution (if correct) is quite different from what I've gone through far. My guess (and then further searching) shows that my solution to this problem is quite different from the approach suggested on various websites. Those solutions define the problem as trying to minimize the cost of cutting a string for $i$ to $j$. I do see the parallels though between mine solution and that one.
<br>
<br>
Because this seems like a unique solution, let's take a small stab at the complexity here. We know there will be $(m) + (m - 1) + ... + 1$ cells. For $m$ cells (the initial diagonal) the cost is constant to fill each one, as there is only 1 case. However, as the diagonal increases, so do the number of cases. Refer to the previous image; the blue diagonal had 2 cases per cell and the green 3. Therefore we come out to something like this: $(1)(m) + (2)(m - 1) + ... (m)(1)$ calculations. The terms of that summation seem to be $O(m^2)$ and there are a total of $m$ terms, which leads to a $O(m^3)$ runtime.
<br>
<br>
A small thought I had afterwards: I'd like to believe that I knew I could have come up with the standard solution everywhere else uses, but realized that was a lot of inefficiency because there is no reason to consider splitting the string into subproblems where cuts are not invovled.

<span class=hljs-addition>+cost but rather the cost of the last step. Let&#x27;s see the example but we also keep</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+track of the cost:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;script type=&quot;text/tikz&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, -&gt;]</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+    \node {(20, 30)}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      child{node {(10, 10)}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+        child{ node {(3, 0)} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+        child{ node {(7, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+        edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      }</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+      child{node {(10, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+  \end{tikzpicture}</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Huh, weird size but whatever, it gets the idea across. Now this is where things</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+get a little crazy. And where I had to do some manual testing to figure it out.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Let&#x27;s try putting together a table:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|  i\j  | 3      | 7        | 10       |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+| :---: | ------ | -------- | -------- |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   3   | (3, 0) | (10, 10) |          |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   7   |        | (7, 0)   | (17, 17) |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|  10   |        |          | (10, 0)  |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+The weird thing is how to actually calculate what goes in the cells. How do I calculate</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+the corner? Well, first, just to be explicit, we &quot;add&quot; tuples with the following</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+function: $add(a, b) = (a[0] + b[0], a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1])$. Let&#x27;s think back</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to our two trees above. We can either do $add((3, 0), (17, 17)) = (20, 37)$ or</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$add((10, 10), (10, 0)) = (20, 20)$ which is the solution. This might be obvious</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+with the tree, and we might glance over it in the case of two cuts, but we need</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+to dig deeper in the case of more cuts. Here&#x27;s another example:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Let&#x27;s try cuts at 4, 6, and 9.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Ok, so as usual, this leaves us with the consecutive segments: 4, 2, 3, 6. Our</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+table looks like this after filling all the way to the 3rd diagonal:</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|  i\j  | 4      | 2      | 3       | 6        |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+| :---: | ------ | ------ | ------- | -------- |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   4   | (4, 0) | (6, 6) | (9, 14) |          |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   2   |        | (2, 0) | (5, 5)  | (11, 16) |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   3   |        |        | (3, 0)  | (9, 9)   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+|   6   |        |        |         | (6, 0)   |</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+But what possibilities do we have for the corner now? Again, think back to the tree.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Or really, the base nodes. Let me just define $f(i, j)$ to be the entry in the table,</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+so we can avoid getting mixed up with the tuples. The equations we can use are</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$, $add(f(4, 4), f(2, 6))$, and $add(f(4, 2), f(3, 6))$. The</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+minimum turns out to be $add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$ which is $(15, 29)$. The minimum</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+cost is 29.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Again, how did we figure out what we could add? Well we thought about the tree, but</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+chances are our program won&#x27;t have the luxury of looking at a tree (or we don&#x27;t</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+want to waste time writing something like that). You probably just need to stare</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+at the table and draw some lines, as that&#x27;s what I did, to find the pattern. Here</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+is a nice image.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;img src=&quot;/blobs/4/dptable.png&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+What you should notice is that for cells on the red diagonal, we calculated the value</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+using cells that were a total of 2 units away from our target cell. For the blue</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+diagonal, we considered cells that were a total of 3 units away, and for the red</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+1. With this, we now have a way to figure out what cells to use when calculating.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+This problem&#x27;s solution (if correct) is quite different from what I&#x27;ve gone through</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+far. My guess (and then further searching) shows that my solution to this problem</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+is quite different from the approach suggested on various websites. Those solutions</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+define the problem as trying to minimize the cost of cutting a string for $i$ to</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+$j$. I do see the parallels though between mine solution and that one.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;br /&gt;</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+Because this seems like a unique solution, let&#x27;s take a small stab at the complexity</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+here. We know there will be $(m) + (m - 1) + ... + 1$ cells. For $m$ cells (the</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+initial diagonal) the cost is constant to fill each one, as there is only 1 case.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+However, as the diagonal increases, so do the number of cases. Refer to the previous</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+image; the blue diagonal had 2 cases per cell and the green 3. Therefore we come</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+out to something like this: $(1)(m) + (2)(m - 1) + ... (m)(1)$ calculations. The</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+terms of that summation seem to be $O(m^2)$ and there are a total of $m$ terms, which</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+leads to a $O(m^3)$ runtime.</span>
<span class=hljs-addition>+&lt;/p&gt;</span>
