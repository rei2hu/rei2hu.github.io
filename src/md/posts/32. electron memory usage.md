# electron memory usage

I decided to try out Electron to build an app. One common concern around
Electron is its resource usage so I attempted to keep track of it. I set up
their [quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) app and
noted took a look at what the memory usage is like:

Around 60mb - arguably good by today's app standards but definitely much higher
than something hand rolled.

I planned to display some visuals about application usage for this app so I had
to hook into the windows api with an addon. Once I wrote that along with some a
very simple pie chart, I decided to take a look at the memory again:

Wow! Did it really just jump 20-30mb because of my addon? You may note that
there is a `(5)` in this screenshot when previously there was a `(4)`. This is
where all the extra memory was being used. Initially I thought it was my addon
as it ran its own thread to hook into windows events... but it wasn't.

It was DevTools.

I added a line to open up DevTools to help debugging when I ran the app and that
is what the new sub-process was. It turns out that not opening DevTools gave me
a much nicer number.

The great thing is you can see this behavior in any Electron app. We can observe
similar behavior with Discord's app.

Why was it +80mb this time? Who knows - maybe they do a lot of stuff with it.
Really, I should be taking the average increase over several opens. Frankly
speaking, the extreme memory usage really dissuades me from using it to develop
my own apps. I think I'm done with this project and I'll just share the addon by
itself without the Electron component.
