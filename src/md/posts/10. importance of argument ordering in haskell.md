# importance of argument ordering in haskell

I think I've come across an important lesson in ordering the parameters for
functions in Haskell. Originally, I wrote a lot of my functions following the
idea that the first parameter to the function is the thing you want to "modify"
(think about how Python/Rust has self as the first argument) For example:

```hs
updateGame :: Game -> ... -> Game
setTiles :: Game -> Tiles -> Game
```

Recently, I've found out that this might not be the best idea. I've been using
`let ... in` constructs as a crutch to avoid crazily nested parenthesis, but I
realized that this is mainly due to my parameter order. For example, with the
above typings if I wanted to use `setTiles` multiple times, I would have to do
something like this

```hs
let g' = setTiles g ts1
    g'' = setTiles g' ts2
in g''
-- or
setTiles (setTiles g ts1) ts2
```

This was fine for shorter lines, but as I progressed on my game, it got
annoying. However, by switching the parameter order to take the thing you want
to "modify" last, it becomes a lot more functional (style-wise):

```hs
setTiles :: Tiles -> Game -> Game
-- amazing!
setTiles ts2 . setTiles ts1 $ g
```

I think this is what people call point-free style.

Eh I didn't test the code above but I assume that would be correct. Anyways,
right now I'm in the process of reordering the parameters for like every single
function so that's fun, but really I'm making the game to learn about Haskell
and I think it's been going well so far (the learning part, but the game part,
too).
