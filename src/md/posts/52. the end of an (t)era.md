# the end of an (t)era

Well, today one of my friends sent me a news link for a game we used to
regularly play (I dropped out after a few years, but he kept playing).

And just for archival's sake:

> Hello TERA players,

> After nearly 10 long years, the TERA legend must sadly come to an end.
> Together we’ve braved so many of Arborea’s perils, fought valiantly against

So when did we play this game? Back in the 2016s - 2020s. Which is like 6 years
ago... before university. It's kind of crazy to think that a game like half of
my age is shutting down.

I didn't do much tooling around the game, but a few interesting notes: I once
tried to reverse some of the client in order to create a chat relay between the
game and a generic messaging platform. I ended up getting banned for some
reason, and when I appealed I was asked where I was logging in from. Also one of
the most interesting game related tools I've ever encountered was TERA proxy
which just made everything client sided in a sense so you could play with a 0
ping feeling - a godsend for Americans playing on EU servers.

Honestly this is going to be the Maplestory post all over again so I'll cut it
short. I had some nice experiences playing the game (I enjoy most games in
general), and I wish I took more screenshots... Well it's not too late to get
some technically but I don't want to download the game. Here are the few I was
able to find:

![crouch](/blobs/52/crouch.jpg)
Here's my main character, a human brawler in a weird crouching position for some
reason.

![underground](/blobs/52/underground.jpg) My secondary character, an elin mystic
that fell under the map.

![whale](/blobs/52/whale.jpg) A character that I ended up deleting based on chat
history, looking at the scenery and having a whale of a time.

The following screenshots are not mine, but were taken from my friend's point of
view. ![buta](/blobs/52/buta.jpg) Another one of my characters, Buta, a Popori
Priest can be barely seen.

![fang](/blobs/52/fang.jpg) Just some funny backstory, I was known as "fang" due
to having fangay in my main character's name.

![kavador](/blobs/52/kavador.jpg) Completing the first boss of Velik's Hold Hard
Mode (a 7 man dungeon) as a healer/tank duo with my friend.

![whale2](/blobs/52/whale2.jpg) We sure had a whale of a time...

Always sad to see a game shut down and for all the work put into making it work
behind it to just disappear. Hopefully it'll be kept alive through private
servers.
