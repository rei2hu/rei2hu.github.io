# another sudoku solver

For some reason solving sudokus popped into my head last night and so I felt
like writing one today. I had the basic idea which was to set up a graph so that
when you solve one cell you know specifically which other cells are affected and
then see if you can solve those. It's basically the common strategy for figuring
out the solution until you have to guess.

I ended up using Go because I thought I would be able to leverage the simple
`go fn` syntax when I got to the guessing part. I ended up writing this in a
couple hours:

```go
package main

    "math"

type Pair struct {
    Row int
    Col int
}

const n = 9

func main() {
    cells := [n][n]int {
        {0, 0, 4, 6, 5, 0, 9, 0, 2},
        {2, 0, 0, 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4},
        {5, 0, 9, 4, 2, 7, 8, 3, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 1, 7},
        {1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 4, 5, 0},
        {0, 5, 3, 7, 6, 0, 2, 8, 9},
        {0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6},
        {0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5},
        {6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    }

    sqrt_n := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))

    var vertices [n][n][n]map[Pair][]int // vertices[x][y][n] contains pairs whose constraints change if n+1 is inserted into cells[x][y]
    var possibilities [n][n][n]bool // p[x][y][n] = true iff n+1 fits in cells[x][y]

    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            for k := 0; k < n; k++ {

            }

                    continue
                }

                l := k + 1
                possible := true

                // check if value can be in cell
                for x := 0; x < n; x++ {

                        cells[i][x] != l && // col
                        cells[x][j] != l // row
                }

                tli := i / sqrt_n * sqrt_n
                tlj := j / sqrt_n * sqrt_n

                for x := 0; x < sqrt_n; x++ {
                    for y := 0; y < sqrt_n; y++ {

But as you can see I quit before actually writing the guessing code because I
lost motivation. My Go code is probably not idiomatic, unless it is, and I found
it annoying to write - partly because I haven't written any in a long time but
mainly because I expect various builtins which Go doesn't provide. I understand
that one of the ideas for Go is to only have one way to do things so maybe
that's why. Hmm, maybe writing all those for loops and if statements was a
little blast from the past. I'm actually surprised I got something that does
what I think it does for this one test case so quickly.

Interestingly enough, the one sample sudoku I picked up randomly off the
internet to test with has two solutions, as running it gives you:

```go
[
    [3 1 4 6 5 8 9 7 2]
    [2 8 7 3 1 9 5 6 4]
    [5 6 9 4 2 7 8 3 1]
    [9 2 8 5 3 4 6 1 7]
    [1 7 6 8 9 2 4 5 3]
    [4 5 3 7 6 1 2 8 9]
    [0 3 2 9 0 5 1 4 6]
    [0 4 1 2 0 6 3 9 5]
    [6 9 5 1 4 3 7 2 8]
]
```

The 0 values at (6, 0), (7, 0), (6, 4), and (7, 4) can either be 7 or 8 and I
see at least two possible orderings. What I planned to do was start goroutines
to fill out a cell with all of the possibilities once all the easy solutions ran
out and then have them race to finish the sudoku and kill the program when any
goroutine completes it (because I have no idea if there's some kind of race
function or if I'll just have to pass a channel around to coordinate. Maybe just
a shared boolean would work.)

I think the graph representation is an interesting idea. Specifically since it's
a list of dependencies, you should be able to do a topological sort to quickly
determine what cells to fill out if the example is modified a bit to produce a
conformant graph. Unfortunately there are a couple issues with this:

1. Sometimes you hit a point where you have to guess, I believe this would
   manifest as a cycle in the graph which means topological sort is useless.
   Although, maybe one idea past this is just to attempt to remove the cycle and
   then perform a topological sort. I haven't put much thought into what this
   means but I think it would kill performance as you would have try removing
   each path in the cycle. However, this also makes me think the idea of
   strongly connected components might also play some role here.
2. One other strategy for determining the value of a cell is if it's the only
   cell in its row/column/subgroup that contains that value. I'm not sure how to
   model that constraint here. I think it could be looked for after all the
   single possibility cells are filled out but before we start forking threads
   or goroutines or whatever.
