# docs gen for rocket.rs websites

So over the past couple of weeks I've been putting together a simple website with
no actual purpose to refresh/learn a few things:

1. Rust
2. rocket
3. Deploying to AWS
4. syn

## rocket

`Rocket` is a framework for rust. In my opinion, it was quite easy to work with and
had many useful features - at least for the simple stuff I did.

### route attributes

A lot of the simplicity is due to the route attributes whose purpose can be found
in other web frameworks. This cuts down on manually writing code to check the method,
url, and even data that is passed to your route.

Let's say you wanted to handle a `post` request to `/game/(dynamic_id)/move`.

In `Express`, you might have something like (double check usage here because I haven't
dealt with `Express` code in like 2 years.):

```js
app.post("/game/:gameId/move", (req, res) => {
    // use req.params.gameId
    // check req.body
})
```

In `rocket`, you could do something like this:

```rs
#[post("/game/<game_id>/move, data = "<data>")]
pub fn move_piece(game_id: u32, data: MoveData) -> String {
    // use game_id and data
}
```

The interesting thing here to note is that we actually have types for `game_id`
and `data` in the rust version. This is pretty cool because now we can take advantage
of types to verify things. If someone made the request to `/game/notanid/move`,
the error is caught just through the type when for Express you still need to write
code to check the game id. Admittedly you still need to check whether the id itself
is a valid one which means both frameworks would still require code to do that.

The same thing is done for data - `MoveData` is a struct that defines certain fields
and can be somehow (may require a separate implementation but there are also helpers
that simplify this) extracted from the request. If the body doesn't match, then `rocket`
won't run this function.

Maybe you want to accept multiple types for a single parameter; you can do this by
having multiple functions with different type signatures.

```rs
#[get("/data/<value>")]
pub fn its_a_string(value: String) -> String {}

#[get("/data/<value>")]
pub fn its_a_i32(value: i32) -> String {}
```

Pretty useful.

### guards

So all of this type stuff in the arguments falls under "Request Guards" for `rocket`.
Any guard needs to implement `FromRequest` which is to say that it is a type that
can be constructed from a `Request`.

In this way, you can implement this for your own needs. For example, maybe you have
endpoints that require a valid authorization header set. You can just create a new
type and implement `FromRequest` for it like so:

```rs
struct AuthorizedUser(i32);
impl<'a, 'r> FromRequest<'a, 'r> for AuthorizedUser {
    type Error = !;
    fn from_request(request: &'a Request<'r>) -> Outcome<Self, Self::Error> {
        // don't follow this implementation please
        match request.headers.get("authorization").find_map(|key| {
            if is_valid_key(key) {
                Some(AuthorizerUser(123))
            } else {
                None
            }
        }) {
            Some(user) => Outcome::Success(user),
            None => Outcome::Forward(),
        }
    }
}

#[get("/my_info", rank = 1)]
pub fn requires_auth(user: AuthorizedUser) -> String {}

#[get("my_info", rank = 2)]
pub fn no_auth() -> String {}
```

If an `AuthorizedUser` can be created from the request, then `requires_auth` is
run. If not, then `no_auth` is run. The rank determines the order the routes are
attempted in. Unfortunately, the `Request` type doesn't include the body so processing
the body has to be done within the actual function.

### other

The return type of the function also has a similar feature, where it has to implement
`Responder`.

There is also a ton of useful stuff for dealing with cookies/databases/state/etc.
I ended up only going over the guards because they will come up later.

## deploying to AWS

Deploying to aws was also pretty simple - I just ssh'd into an EC2 instance, cloned,
built, and ran. I ended up not using docker because the project was simple enough
to not need control the environment and I only plan to run/develop it on that single
instance.

I did run into a couple of snags though; the main one being actually being able
to get ssh access. I don't know the exact steps I took to get to the point, but
I was in a situation where there were no entries in the route table so the EC2
instance couldn't be accessed through the internet.

Setting up a domain name, nginx, and certbot for LetsEncrypt certificates was also
straightforward and relatively hassle free.

I'm not sure how I'd compare this deployment to Heroku because they do seem to be
fundamentally different - Procfile vs actual ssh control. I do prefer being able
to ssh in to the (virtual) machine though.

## docs gen

So this is probably the actual crux of the project - I've built too many websites
for me to call the actual website its own project because learning a new web framework
really doesn't mean much to me anymore.

As explained earlier, a lot of rocket is dependent on attributes - the routes use
route attributes and a lot of the types can also be set up without having to write
entire implementations by using attributes. Naturally, given this, it should be possible
to automatically generate some kind of file with information on what a route takes/returns.

For example:

```rs
#[derive(Responder)]
enum MyResponseEnum {
    #[response(status = 200, content_type = "application/json")]
    GoodStuff(i32, String),
    #[response(status = 400)]
    BadRequest(i32, i32),
    #[response(status = 500, content_type = "text")]
    InternalError { body: String, header1: i32 },
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct LoginData {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

#[post("/login", data=<login_data>, content_type = "application/json")]
pub fn login(data: Json<LoginData>) -> Login {}
```

It looks like there is a `/login` endpoint which takes a `Json<LoginData>` which
means an object like `{ username: "", string: "" }` and returns a `Login` variant
which is either a 200 or 401 response code.

Based on the attributes we can determine a lot of the information for the route,
and if we could extract that, maybe generate documentation for it automatically.

### syn

What `syn` can do is transform valid Rust code (provided as a `String` or `TokenStream`)
into an abstract syntax tree. And then we just need to extract the various bits
from the tree to help generate our documentation.

Consider the enum in the above snippet. We can have `syn` parse it like so.

```rs
&syn::parse_str(
"
#[derive(Responder)]
enum MyResponseEnum {
    #[response(status = 200, content_type = \"application/json\")]
    GoodStuff(i32, String),
    #[response(status = 400)]
    BadRequest(i32, i32),
    #[response(status = 500, content_type = \"text\")]
    InternalError { body: String, header1: i32 },
}
",
)
.unwrap()
```

This generates a huge syntax tree (looks like I should add some collapsible thing
for code blocks... also feel free to skip because I'll point out the important parts):

```rs
ItemEnum {
    attrs: [
        Attribute {

}

This is nice, but the first thing we actually want is to check if the enum derives
`Responder`. Here is the interesting stuff below:

```rust
ItemEnum {
    attrs: [
        Attribute {
            path: Path {
                leading_colon: None,
                segments: [
                    PathSegment {
                        ident: Ident(
                            derive,
                        ),
                        arguments: None,
                    },
                ],
            },
            tokens: TokenStream [
                Group {
                    delimiter: Parenthesis,
                    stream: TokenStream [
                        Ident {
                            sym: Responder,
                        },
                    ],
                },
            ],
            ..
        },
    ],
```

We want an `ItemEnum` where an element of `attrs` is an `Attribute` whose which
has a `path` whose first `segment`'s `ident` is `derive`. This tells us that there
is a derive macro. But wait, that's not all - we still need to check for `Responder`.

Unfortunately at this point, the ast turns back into a `TokenStream` which is not
ideal for us. Fortunately, there is a [`parse_meta`](https://docs.rs/syn/0.15.26/syn/struct.Attribute.html#method.parse_meta)
method for attributes which we can use here.

Once we run something like `enum.attrs.iter().map(|attr| attr.parse_meta().unwrap()).collect::<Vec<syn::Meta>>()`,
we end up with an array of nodes - in this case:

```rs
[
    List(
        MetaList {
            path: Path {
                leading_colon: None,
                segments: [
                    PathSegment {
                        ident: Ident(
                            derive,
                        ),
                        arguments: None,
                    },
                ],
            },
            paren_token: Paren,
            nested: [
                Meta(
                    Path(
                        Path {
                            leading_colon: None,
                            segments: [
                                PathSegment {
                                    ident: Ident(
                                        Responder,
                                    ),
                                    arguments: None,
                                },
                            ],
                        },
                    ),
                ),
            ],
        },
    ),
]
```

By using `parse_meta`, we end up with a more straightforward representation which
allows us to find what we are looking for more easily. `derive` is still there normally,
but now we see that there is a `Path` with 1 segment with `Responder`. So now we
know a simple way to figure out if something derives responder:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
```rs
fn derives_responder(enm: syn::ItemEnum) -> bool {
    enm.attrs.iter().any(|attr| {
        attr.parse_meta()
            .ok()
            .and_then(|meta| {
                match meta {
                    // check for derive
                    syn::Meta::List(meta_list @ syn::MetaList { path, nested, .. })
                        if path
                            .get_ident()
                            .map_or(false, |ident| ident.to_string() == "derive") =>
                    {
                        // check for Responder
                        nested.any(|meta| match meta {
                            syn::NestedMeta::Meta(syn::Meta::Path(path)) => {
                                Some(path.segments.pairs().any(|segment| {
                                    segment.value().ident.to_string() == "Responder"
                                }))
                            }
                            _ => None,
                        })
                    }
                    _ => None,
                }
            })
            .unwrap_or(false)
    })
}
```

This the exact code I wrote (and I'm not fully sure if this works because I'm just
typing this up on the go, like most of my "examples"), because attributes are a
large part of this so I ended up moving attribute extraction to its own thing. But
hopefully it looks ok.

This example really encompasses most of the logic that is necessary to get things
rolling - whether it be an attribute or function return types, I was able to use
similar approaches for extracting or determining what data I wanted to use.

The example I run for in the main file for the generator itself is this:

```rs
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}

#[derive(Responder)]
pub enum LoginResponse {
    #[response(status = 200, content_type = "text/plain")]
    Success(i32),
    #[response(status = 401, content_type = "text/plain")]
    Failure(String),
}

struct LoginData {
    username: String,
    password: String,
}

#[post("/login", format="application/json", data = "<data>")]
fn login(user: User, data: LoginData) -> LoginResponse {
    if username == "a" && password == "b" {
        LoginResponse::Success(user.id)
    } else {
        LoginResponse::Failure("Bad login")
    }
}

#[derive(Responder)]
#[response(status=200)]
struct LogoutResponse {
    body: String
}

#[post("/logout", format="text")]
fn logout(user: User) -> LogoutResponse {
    LogoutResponse {
        body: "you're out".to_string()
    }
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![hello]).launch();
}
```

The output is this (with a few tweaks):

```js

        "ident": "hello",

I think it's not bad so far - it captures all structs, and information about functions/enums
if they have `rocket` attributes. The plan is this json blob can be used to then
generate a docs page.

### limitations

A lot of functionality in `rocket` can be done through these attribute macros, but
as mentioned earlier, sometimes you want to implement traits manually... which is
a lot more work to figure out.

Fortunately, for me, I did end up using attributes and derive macros more or less
everywhere. In certain parts, I might have implemented `FromRequest` a few times.
For this stuff, I end up just writing things manually for explanation.

Another issue is that the path does not determine the full path because it's also
dependent on where the routes are mounted. I think this starts to step outside of
just parsing because we start getting into actually having to go through the body
of the code which is actually interpreting and running it. For example:

```rs
mod routes;

fn my_routes() -> Vec<Route> {
    vec![routes::login]
}

// ...
let url = env::var(URL_MOUNT_POINT);
rocket.ignite().mount(url, my_routes());
```

No real idea to figure out where this stuff goes, but at least we can more or less
glean some information about `routes::login` from the attribute and types on it.
