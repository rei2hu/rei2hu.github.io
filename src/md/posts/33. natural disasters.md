# natural disasters

Here I am, stuck in the path of a natural disaster and based on what I've read,
it's a bad one. I guess I have a non-zero chance of dying.

Well, with my current attitude towards life it doesn't seem to be a big deal,
although my apathy may change in my final moments - if I get to experience them.
That isn't to say that I wouldn't have evacuated given the chance, but rather I
don't mind either outcome. Note that the main reason I didn't evacuate was
because this was a sudden (relatively speaking) occurrence and should have been
a much less severe natural disaster.

Even then, perhaps I've just grown old and stubborn. Hey, at least I have an
excuse to not go into work. Actually last week was the first week I thought to
myself "dang it's Saturday, which means tomorrow is Sunday, and the day after
that I have to work." Hmm, doesn't seem like I'm getting better.

Anyways, the main reason I wanted to write this was to create a potential last
post type deal. Lack of closure is something that's quite disappointing - and if
anyone ever comes across these posts, I'd like to close them properly. If
nothing else is posted after this, then chances are I died. Unfortunate.

I expect to be in range in a few hours or so, so wish me and everyone around
this area good luck. Right now I'm quite comfortable, and I assume it won't be
the case then. Interesting how things have the potential to change so quickly.

This might have been a little too melodramatic.
