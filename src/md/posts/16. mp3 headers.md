# mp3 headers

Recently, I wanted to try my hand at figuring out a way to hash mp3s in such a way
that the result is based on the actual sounds (music) contained in the mp3. This
basically came about as a result that I wanted to search for a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdy6rLbQ-c)
that was playing in the background of another video.

I was able to eventually source it manually, but it's gotten me to try to do the
above problem.

## the mp3 file format

The first hurdle was to decode a mp3 file in such a way that I get data that I actually
want. Many libraries exist for messing with mp3s, but I could not find one that would
simply give me the pitches over time. So I figured this would be a good side project
to start on. And one where I could use Rust to prevent my Rust skills from getting
any more rusty.

Unfortunately, the official mp3 specification looks like it has to be bought for
[around \$200](https://www.iso.org/standard/22412.html) which was quite surprising
to me. It's interesting how things like this are locked behind a paywall.

Fortunately, in addition to a lot of open source implementations to reference, I
am not the first person to attempt this, so there is a lot of unofficial information
on the internet.

Oh, but first I had to get my hands on an mp3 file. But that's the easy part.
It happens to be one of [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDjYDfRunUk).

### frame header

Based on what I've read, an overwhelming part of the bytes in an mp3 is organized
in frames, where each frame contains audio information.

The way to determine a frame is to look for 11 (or 12) consecutive 1 bits, which
give the pattern FF F\_ or FF E\_. I mention 12 because it seems like it used to
be 12 until an updated standard came out and cut it down to 11.

I took a look at my mp3 with `xxd -g 1 otome_dissection.mp3 | less`, I am presented
with the following:

```bash

```

The first thing I see is [ID3](https://id3.org/), which indicates some metadata
that I will not care about for this project. Continuing to scan the bytes, we see
the `ff fb` pattern at `0x0000008a`. This indicates the start of the frame header.

At this point, I wondered to myself - why can't `ff f/e` be somewhere in the metadata?
Well, while I did say I didn't care about the ID3 data, I did glance at the [documented
layout](https://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure) and this seems to be handled by the
sections "The unsynchronisation scheme" (and another section after it).

> Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed
> byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte.

Cool, so that's a thing. But let's get back to the frame header. The frame header
is 8 bytes (32 bits) long, so the header in our case will be `ff fb b0 00`. The frame
header contains information about 13 different things through its bits. The best
source I've found so far on this has been from [this website](http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/mpeghdr.htm).

Let's see what our frame header says. For simplicity, let's convert `ff fb b0 00`
to bits `11111111 11111011 10110000 00000000`.

1. Frame Sync
2. MPEG version 1
3. Layer 3
4. No CRC
5. 192 kbps bitrate
6. 44100 Hz frequency
7. Not padded
8. Private bit not set
9. Stereo
10. Intensity stereo off, MS stereo off
11. Not copyrighted
12. A copy of the original
13. No emphasis

And we can also use the bitrate/frequency to determine the frame size

<p>
$floor(144 *bitrate / frequency + padding) \rightarrow floor(144* 192000 / 44100
+ 0) = 626$
</p>

This suggests the next frame will start from `0x0000008a + 626` or `0x000002fc`,
so let's look further.

```bash
000002b0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
000002c0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
000002d0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
000002e0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
000002f0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff fb b0 64  ...............d
00000300: 00 0f f0 00 00 69 00 00 00 08 00 00 0d 20 00 00  .....i....... ..
00000310: 01 00 00 01 a4 00 00 00 20 00 00 34 80 00 00 04  ........ ..4....
00000320: 4c 41 4d 45 33 2e 39 39 2e 35 55 55 55 55 55 55  LAME3.99.5UUUUUU
```

Here, we have another occurrence of `ff f_` at the offset we expected `0x000002fc`.

## the basic code

Pardon my Rust.

Now with a sufficient understanding of the basics of frame headers, I started
writing. First, a method to find the frame sync.

```rust
fn find_frame_header_pos(f: &mut BufReader<File>) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut next_byte = [0];
    loop {
        let check = f
            // we discard until we find 0xff, which suggests perhaps the start of
            // the frame header, which will be 0xfff or 0xffe
            .read_until(0xff, &mut vec![])
            .and_then(|_| f.read(&mut next_byte));

        match check {
            // no more bytes to read
            Ok(0) => return None,
            // we found 0xffe or 0xfff
            Ok(_) if next_byte[0] & 0xe0 == 0xe0 => {
                return Some(f.seek(SeekFrom::Current(-2)).unwrap() as usize);
            }
            // we found 0xff(not f or e), we dont have to seek backwards because
            // we know we didn't skip f
            Ok(_) => continue,
            // there was a file reading error or something
            Err(_) => return None,
        }
    }}
}
```

Which is used in main like so:

```rust
let mut buf_reader = BufReader::new(File::open("tests/otome dissection remix.mp3")?);
while let Some(header_pos) = find_frame_header(&mut buf_reader) {
    // do something with header_pos
}
```

Now, I had to make a struct for the frame header. I was lazy and was putting much
more emphasis on getting things to work, so I simply wrapped `u32` as I know the
frame header is 4 bytes long.

And then the methods just use bitwise operations for now.

```rust
struct FrameHeader(u32);

impl FrameHeader {
    // TODO: enums for everything
    fn get_audio_version(&self) -> u8 {
        ((self.0 & 0x00180000) >> 19) as u8
    }
    // etc
}
```

But I also took the time to hackily implement `From<[u8; 4]>` because that's the
type of the buffer the reader will read the bytes into!

```rust
impl From<[u8; 4]> for FrameHeader {
    fn from(nums: [u8; 4]) -> Self {
        FrameHeader(nums.iter().fold(0, |reduced, x| (reduced << 8 | *x as u64)))
    }
}
```

And it is used within the while loop like so

```rust
let mut header_buf = [0; 4];
buf_reader.read(&mut header_buf)?;
let frame_header = FrameHeader::from(header_buf);
```

Everything sems to be working quite well and I'm happy that I've progressed this
far in a day. Unfortunately, I believe the toughest part will be decoding the actual
audio data. And the fact that I have to do a large refactor... For example my `get_bitrate`
function is actually a huge match like this:

```rust
let code = (self.0 & 0x0000F000) >> 12;
let layer = self.get_layer_description();
let audio_version = self.get_audio_version();

match (code, audio_version, layer) {
    // MPEG version 1, layer 1
    (0, 3, 3) => 0, // free
    (1, 3, 3) => 32,
    (2, 3, 3) => 64,
    (3, 3, 3) => 96,
    // etc
}
```

Yuck!
