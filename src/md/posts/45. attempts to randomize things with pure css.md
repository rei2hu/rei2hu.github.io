# attempts to randomize things with pure css

I was adding some simple things to my site and I ended up wanting to add some animations.
Of course, I don't want the same animation to play every time you visit, but a random
one. Since I try to keep the javascript low on this sight so I thought I'd try to
get it done with pure css. For some reason I thought there was a `rand()` function
because I swear I used it a long time ago but it looks like I was mistaken. I ended
up spending all of my time trying to generate a semblance of randomness somehow.
So what other sources of randomness are there? This is all tested on Firefox.

Css is pretty limited in what it can do so this would be difficult. My first idea
was just to take advantage of time - I could create various images and flip through
them by animating the z-indices. Once something happens, I stop animating. I ended
up with something like this:

```html
<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        .container-45 {
            --height: 100px;
            --width: 100px;
            position: relative;
            height: var(--height);
            width: var(--width);
            overflow: hidden;
        }

        .box {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0px;
            width: var(--width);
            height: var(--height);
            animation: flicker 1s running infinite steps(4, end);
        }

        @keyframes flicker {
            from { z-index: 1; }
            to { z-index: 3; }
        }

        .container-45 .box:nth-child(1n) { animation-delay: 0s; background-color: red; }
        .container-45 .box:nth-child(2n) { animation-delay: -0.33s; background-color: blue; }
        .container-45 .box:nth-child(3n) { animation-delay: -0.66s; background-color: green; }
    </style>

    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>

            --height: 100px;
            --width: 100px;
            position: relative;
            height: var(--height);
            width: var(--width);
            overflow: hidden;
        }

        .box {

            animation: flicker 1s running infinite steps(4, end);
        }

        @keyframes flicker {
            from { z-index: 1; }
            to { z-index: 3; }
        }

        .container-45 .box:nth-child(1n) { animation-delay: 0s; background-color: red; }
        .container-45 .box:nth-child(2n) { animation-delay: -0.33s; background-color: blue; }
        .container-45 .box:nth-child(3n) { animation-delay: -0.66s; background-color: green; }

Not bad, now I just need some way to stop the animation based on a random user action.
Like every other css hack out there, I ended up using [pseudoclasses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)
to do the hard lifting - in this case `:hover`. Unfortunately there is no way to
select all siblings of an element and I can only use the general sibling combinator
`~` to select elements after one. This means if I hover over an element, I can only
then apply states to the elements after it. Well, no matter because I ended up coming
with another idea: another animated element that moves around the screen that then
pauses all the animation when it is hovered. I ended up just having a window wiper
move across the screen kind of. It shouldn't be visible but I'll show it because
it's a demo.

```html
<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        #wiper {
            transform-origin: 0 0;
            position: absolute;
            top: -5px;
            left: 0px;
            width: calc(var(--height) + var(--width));
            height: 10px;
            background-color: black;
            animation: wipe 3s running infinite linear alternate;
            z-index: 10;
        }

        #wiper:hover {
            animation-play-state: paused;
        }

        #wiper:hover ~ .box {
            animation-play-state: paused;
        }

        @keyframes wipe {
            to { transform: rotate(90deg); }
        }
    </style>

    <div id="wiper"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        #wiper {
            transform-origin: 0 0;
            position: absolute;
            top: -5px;
            left: 0px;
            width: calc(var(--height) + var(--width));
            height: 10px;
            background-color: black;
            animation: wipe 3s running infinite linear alternate;
            z-index: 10;
        }

        #wiper:hover {
            animation-play-state: paused;
        }

        #wiper:hover ~ .box {
            animation-play-state: paused;
        }

        @keyframes wipe {
            to { transform: rotate(90deg); }
        }
    </style>

    <div id="wiper"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>

Note how once you hover over the wiper the animation stops! Now the issue is that
once you move off the wiper it continues. This might be what you want but maybe you
want to freeze the behavior. What I came up with was to expand the wiper once it
gets hovered - if it takes up the entire screen then it's constantly hovered! I'm
lowering the opacity just so we can see the color behind it.

```html
<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        #wiper.wiper-2:hover {
            animation-name: none;
            height: calc(var(--height) + 5px);
            width: var(--width);
            opacity: 25%;
        }
    </style>

    <div id="wiper" class="wiper-2"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        #wiper.wiper-2:hover {
            animation-name: none;
            height: calc(var(--height) + 5px);
            width: var(--width);
            opacity: 25%;
        }
    </style>

    <div id="wiper" class="wiper-2"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>

This works great! Just remember this will take up the entire page rather than the
small 100x100 in these demos! Until you realize that moving your mouse outside the
browser breaks the behavior. Well, that's what we get for relying on hover! Is there
maybe another way to do things?

Basically the issue we're having is somehow keeping a consistent state - when we
use `:hover` we're counting on the user to stay hovering until we want them to stop.
Looking through the other pseudoclasses, I came across `:focus`. What if we leveraged
`input`, `focus`, and `autofocus`? It looks something like this:

```html
<style>
    #click-listener {
        position: absolute;
        top: -100px;
        opacity: 0;
    }

    #click-listener:not(:focus) ~ .box {
        animation-play-state: paused;
    }
</style>

<input id="click-listener" autofocus tabindex="-1" />
<div class="box"></div>
<div class="box"></div>
<div class="box"></div>
```

<div class="container-45">
    <style>
        #click-listener {
            position: absolute;
            top: -100px;
            opacity: 0;
        }

        #click-listener:not(:focus) ~ .box {
            animation-play-state: paused;
        }
    </style>

    <input id="click-listener" autofocus tabindex="-1" />
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
    <div class="box"></div>
</div>

If you've already clicked elsewhere on the page, then the animation would've stopped.
Go ahead, refresh the page, and scroll down here and you can see the animation continuing
as long as you haven't clicked off of anything!

One interesting thing is that the reason I used `opacity: 0` instead of something
like `display: none` is because even with `autofocus`, I think `display: none` gets
applied initially and then the element isn't focused. I had though this meant
`display: none` automatically unfocuses the element but this isn't the case. It
would've been great because we could combine `:hover` and `autofocus`; hovering
an element would set `display: none` and unfocus the input then we base things on
if the element is focused or not.

So overall I haven't really found a solution I like, but these are some interesting
ideas. This is less of a random number generation and more like get a random element
from my pregenerated list of things.
