# exposition in technical posts

Sometimes I write a post about solving a problem, like my
[previous one](/posts/93). And I feel like as a random internet user, one would
likely be more interested in the solution rather than the extraneous details.

There seems to be similar sentiment among people searching for recipes online,
where a lot of recipes are prefaced by a couple paragraphs of history.

As such, I think a good idea is to put the solutions up front, and then follow
them with the story going forwards.
