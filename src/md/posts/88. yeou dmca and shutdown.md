# yeou dmca and shutdown

So, if you don't know, I enjoy old-school Maplestory. And a couple of years ago
a project known as Yeou was publicized.

The innovative thing here was the client, which was rewritten in such a way that
it supported multiple compilation targets including web (via wasm).

As such, I tried the game back then and it had issues during alpha as expected:

But still somewhat worked (I was playing with a friend and we would always
disconnect when entering the same map)

A few things I noted while testing the application was the use of canvas for the
graphics, websocket for the connection, and how it downloaded what looked like
official assets off of some cdn each time you loaded the game. Not ideal, so I
thought I would give it some time and check in on it later, and it did improve
over time.

Unfortunately, there was too much pressure from somewhere, and four days after
the beta test on November 25, one of the two developers on the project shared
the following:

> our first DMCA takedown for the web version of the game (web.yeou.app). This
> was a little earlier than we expected as it was still a fairly small alpha

> the last one did so we ignored it.

I can definitely see the cdn complying because they were hosting official
content, but I'm not so sure about the rest of the things as the client and
server are supposedly reversed/written from scratch. And even worse, none of the
work is planned to be open sourced.

Why did this DMCA work on this server when there are other much longer lived
servers? Based on the above quote, the developer doesn't have anonymity so
whoever is going after them (Nexon?) was able to tie things to their real world
identity.

Sad times...
