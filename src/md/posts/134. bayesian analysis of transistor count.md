# bayesian analysis of transistor count

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)

Though surely this can't hold forever, whether that's due to slowed
technological innovation or some physical property of silicon or gold atoms or
whatever (don't ask me, I'm not a physicist!)

Whether or not this will continue to hold true, for now, if it is, it would
imply that the transistor count $t$ of a microprocessor is roughly
$t \approx \alpha
\cdot 2^{y/2}$ where $\alpha$ is some positive constant and $y$
is the year.

Using the equation from earlier, we can model $log(t)$ as a simple linear
regression, i.e. $log(t) \approx log(\alpha) + y \cdot \frac{log(2)}{2}$, and we
can create a model for that with uninformative priors because I have no idea
what the values could be, or rather, we'll let the modeling software figure it
out:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

$$
log(t_i)\text{ | }\beta_1, \beta_2, \sigma^2, y_i \sim N(\beta_1 + (y_i - \bar{y_i}) \cdot \beta_2)
$$

$$
\beta_1, \beta_2 \sim N(0, 1000)
$$

$$
\sigma \sim \Gamma(0.001, 0.001)
$$

Now we just need some data to fit it with. Fortunately, Wikipedia also has
[an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors) on
that. Here's the data sourced from the article at the time of writing that and
that I've somewhat cleaned, using the highest possible value for the count e.g.
sometimes it said "x - y" and I would choose y or "x (y excluding...)" where I
would choose x.

We have our data and we have our model; now let's write it in Stan.

```stan
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  vector[N] Year;
  vector[N] logCount;
}
transformed data {
  real meanYear = mean(Year); // center year
}
parameters {
  real beta1;
  real beta2;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  beta1 ~ normal(0, 1000);
  beta2 ~ normal(0, 1000);
  sigma ~ gamma(0.001, 0.001);

  for (i in 1 : N)
    logCount[i] ~ normal(beta1 + beta2 * (Year[i] - meanYear), sigma);
}
```

And fit it to the dataset in R.

```R
fit = stan(model_code = model_code,
           data = list(N = length(data$Processor),
                       logCount = log(data$Count),
                       Year = data$Year),
           chains = 4,
           seed = 123)
```

Then check the posterior summary.

Convergence statistics look good (and the trace plots look fine trust me!)

This gives a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_2$ to be around (0.310, 0.336).
However, our originally calculated coefficient for $y$ was $log(2) / 2$ or
around $0.347$; this suggests that $log(t)$ has not been increasing as fast as
Moore's law would imply, so I guess we've already fallen behind!

At least according to this analysis.
