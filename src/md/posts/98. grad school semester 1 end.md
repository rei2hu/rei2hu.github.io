# grad school semester 1 end

The end of my classes for the semester are soon or have passed. What are my
thoughts on them overall?

Wow it feels like I just wrote the halfway post... well it was 3 posts ago.

## Databases

I took this course thinking it would cover database internals. It did not.
Instead it was more of a practical introduction to databases which for
undergraduates.

The first third of the course focused on different types of databases (mainly
relational, document, and graph databases) common operations, and relational
algebra. The main project for this course was to implement some of these
operations (select, join, etc.) in a skeleton Python program; this was not a
proper database implementation, but something rough to work with. I guess this
was to help learn how things work, but it seemed to simple for the course.

The second third (what?) of the course covered actually querying the databases.
We went over syntax for MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. Based on what I already know
of sql, the syntax being taught was a little dated, and I would say the same for
Mongo, though I'm not sure about Neo4j since I have no experience there. The
projects for this section were solid, and they mainly consisted of constructing
queries to solve a plain english questions. The output was provided so we could
tell if our queries were correct ahead of time.

The last eighth of the course (the database syntax part did take a little more
than a third) introduced basic internals like B+ trees, hash tables and their
use in indexing. This is the content I was hoping to cover, but in a more
advanced format. Unfortunately it never happened.

The main/final project of the course was to create a webapp that used the 3
aforementioned databases; which was simple and really drives home the "this is a
practical database course" theme. I whipped something together over 1 weekend
and I think it should be good enough for the class based on the example projects
that were given.

I did not interact much with the class because it was easily completable solo,
all grading was strictly defined, and, well, as I mentioned before, the forums
were 99% unhelpful spam from people posting to hit the top of the number of
posts leaderboards for extra credit.

I have finished everything for the class, and expect to get some kind of A. Did
you know that some places have pluses and minuses? I was unaware, but I guess
I'll either get an A or A+ despite rushing the final and losing out on 1% of the
total possible grade.

## High Performance Computing (HPC)

While databases was mainly focused on practical applications, HPC had a good mix
of theoretical and practical application. The content was good but the course
was severely unorganized.

The class started off with basics like memory hierarchy and cache misses,
transitioning into actual high performance computing using OpenMP, MPI, and
pthreads while touching upon things like locks and atomics. We were shown
examples of parallel algorithms with special focus on prefix sums and sorting.
Then we got into load balancing, isoefficiency, topologies, and fault tolerance.

The projects were also, in general, very good and focused on improving program
performance by using the topics being taught, and seeing the improvements by
benchmarking them on a cluster. The first one was matrix multiplication two
ways - tiled and transposed, the second one was another tile based decomposition
of a Gauss-Seidel program, the third was a gas particle simulation, and the
final was a parallel sort.

However, as I mentioned earlier, the organization was terrible. Most assignments
after the first were released late, and there was minimal feedback for anything.
The gas particle simulation only used half of the grading criteria, which meant
effort spent on the other half was just wasted. Sometimes the criteria was just
outdated, and despite asking about it weeks before the deadline, there would be
no answer until the due date.

While I thought the course was definitely harder compared to databases, this
course either has the worst students, is virtually impossible to some, or a
combination of both. I'll start off with this one note from the instructor which
should put things into perspective:

Yes, multiple people posted their (unformatted) code to the public forums
looking for help. People have also posted exam questions and their answers to
the forums to check if they're correct or not... during the exam. Pretty crazy
for graduate school.

Unfortunately the forum has the option to be fully anonymous so I'm not sure if
all the students could be caught.

Another thing to look at would be the fact that the gas simulation project was
due a couple of weeks ago. While we did have several weeks to complete it, a
majority of people must have put it off because there were so, so many people
mentioning that the cluster queues were backed up from others using it at the
same time (this is exacerbated by the fact that the program itself takes 10
minutes to run normally and people were submitting code that would run until a 1
hour timeout due to deadlocks). I have a suspicion that a lot of people did not
do well on that project, though it could just be a vocal few.

So is my "you're probably not determined/focused enough for graduate school"
rant from my last post justified? I'd like to think so.

The forums were decent outside of the begging for extensions and grade
improvements.

I actually answered like 60% of the real questions there. Where's my extra
credit? It even supported latex, which is pretty cool though I guess is table
stakes for higher education forums. I can actually post some of my answers
because why not; I took the time to write them out there.

<summary>Fault Tolerance</summary>
Where did you get those equations? I used
$$
\tau(\text{opt}) = \sqrt{2\delta(M + R)}
$$
For finding the optimal check point period. Previously it was 16:
$$
\tau_{old} = 16 = \sqrt{2\delta_1(M + R)} \Rightarrow \delta_1(M + R) = 128
$$
Checkpointing overhead is reduced by 4x, i.e. checkpointing is 4x faster than before
$$
\delta_1 = 4\delta_2 \Rightarrow \delta_2(M+R) = 32
$$
Then you can solve it again with that
$$
\tau_{new}= \sqrt{2\delta_2(M + R)} = \sqrt{2 * 32} = 8
$$

<summary>Isoefficiency</summary>
It's communication divided by computation

problem size ($N$) to work ($w$): $w = N^2 \Rightarrow \sqrt{w} = N$

communication divided by computation:

$$
\frac{N *log(p)}{\sqrt{p}} /
\frac{N^2}{p} = \frac{p* log(p)}{N\sqrt{p}} = \frac{p *
log(p)}{\sqrt{w}\sqrt{p}}
$$

substitute work in:

$$
k_1 =  \frac{p *log(p)}{\sqrt{w}\sqrt{p}} \Rightarrow
k_1\sqrt{w} =  \frac{p* log(p)}{\sqrt{p}} \Rightarrow {k_1}^2w = p *log(p)^2
\Rightarrow w = k_2* p * log(p)^2
$$

$k_1$ is just a constant so $1/{k_1}^2$ is just another constant I'm calling
$k_2$

It's really just basic math and knowing what formula to use, but I guess that's
computer science.

For this class, the final sorting project (15%) and the final exam (25%) are
still pending. I've finished the project though, so really it's just the final
in a week which will be open book anyways. Because the class has been
historically difficult, it uses 15 point intervals (85 A, 70 B, etc), which
means only an 85% should be necessary for an A, and right now I have around a
58/60, which means I could get 65%s on both final project and final exam and
come out with an A.

Update: I got an A+ in all of my classes. I honestly did not expect it
considering how I slacked off towards the end and started dropping points, but
I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles.

## summer semester

I've also registered for 3 classes this summer. They should be a lot easier than
what I'm currently taking.
