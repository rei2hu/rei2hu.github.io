# dropping a table with constraints

If you can't drop an unused table with constraints due to deadlock issues, try
dropping the constraints individually first.

Recently someone was cleaning up a large table by detaching and dropping an
unused partition in postgres. It lead to a deadlock message.

```sh
prod=> drop table r1_partition;
ERROR: deadlock detected
DETAIL: Process p1 waits for AccessExclusiveLock on relation r2 of database d1;
blocked by process p2. Process p2 waits for AccessShareLock on relation r3 of
database d1; blocked by process p1.

Time: 20000 ms
```

We can easily see the deadlock where p1 has a lock on what p2 wants, and p2 has
a lock on what p1 wants. Checking the server log lead to seeing a query like the
following:

```sql
select * from r2 join r3 join r4
```

The important thing to note is that this query is not related, at all to
r1\_partition. However it is joining tables that r1_partition has references to.

While I haven't verified this explanation, I believe the reason is this:

Postgres implements foreign key references by using triggers. Deleting a trigger
requires Access Exclusive locks on the table, so dropping a table requires
Access Exclusive locks on all referenced tables.

The select requires Access Shared locks on some of those tables which conflicted
with the Access Exclusive locks.

It was able to get a lock on r2 while the drop process was able to acquire its
lock for r3, which caused the deadlock when trying to drop the partition.

```sh
Foreign-key constraints:
    "fk1" FOREIGN KEY (x) references r2(x)
    "fk2" FOREIGN KEY (y) references r3(x)
```

The way we got around this was to drop the constraint first.

```sh
prod=> alter table r1_partition drop constraint fk1;
ALTER TABLE
Time: 25000 ms
prod => drop table r1_partition;
DROP TABLE
TIME: 100ms
```
