# a little append only ds idea

So I randomly thought of what might be a decent append-only data structure;

The core idea is that it is just a bunch of infinitely nested arrays whose sizes
correspond to cache sizes to minimize cache misses/randomized data access.

We start out with a normal array, and fill it up. Once filled, we make a parent
array and add a pointer to the original array in the first position and add a pointer
to a new array in the next position, then we have a new array to fill and repeat
the process when this is filled. Once the parent array is filled, we create a new
parent array and repeat.

It is pretty simple, but I've only really thought of its use for logs specifically;
should be pretty efficient and you should be able to search for things by a timestamp
pretty quickly. In fact, this is like building a B-tree from the root nodes and
just in order. I guess it's a B-tree?

Oh well, I doubt I'm the first person to come up with this idea.
