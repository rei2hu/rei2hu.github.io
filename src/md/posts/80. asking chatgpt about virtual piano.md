# asking chatgpt about virtual piano

I was talking with a friend about virtual piano and we decided to ask chatGPT
about it.

What is virtual piano? It is software that allows you to play music with just
your computer keyboard - hitting a computer key generates a sound, similar to
hitting a piano key (I do not play actual piano so I am unfamiliar with other
nuances like pedals). There are several implementations of this, and, in
general, the main difference between them is the mapping of computer key to
piano key to sound. The key layout typically falls under one of these
categories:

1. Layout 1: shift used for half steps

    - <https://people.rit.edu/~sky3947/JS%20Piano/index.html>
    - <https://app.pianorhythm.io/>
    - <https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104548572>
    - <https://recursivearts.com/virtual-piano/>

2. Layout 2: a layout I'm unfamiliar with

    - <https://multiplayerpiano.com/>
    - <https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano>
    - <https://virtualpiano.eu/>

There is a lot of sheet music out there, and while notation differs between
sheets there is the common rule of spacing, keys, and chords with square
brackets. There are various sites that host sheet music transcriptions, tools to
help with transcribing, and many other things such as:

- <https://trello.com/c/bMxrPxlw/33-comprehensive-list-of-other-sheet-sources>
- <https://vpsheets.com/>
- <https://github.com/lclion/MIDIPianoSheetCreator>

Most, if not all, of these websites have sheet music or generate sheet music
using layout 1.

Now that you've been introduced to the concept of the virtual piano, let's look
at the opening for an arrangement of Pachelbel's Canon in C for layout 1. It's a
very common song so it should sound familiar.

```txt
8 w t u 5 9 w r 6 0 e t 3 7 0 w
4 8 q e 1 5 8 0 4 8 q e 5 9 w r
[8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w
[4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e [5a] 9 w r
```

I'll use the autoplay feature of the first link to play it, but you can use any
of the layout 1 links to play along.

Sounds nice doesn't it? There is a lot of sheet music out there and I would say
this is on the more basic side of things. I'd definitely encourage anyone that
may enjoy playing music to try learning virtual piano - all you need are quick
fingers and a sense of time. I've spent years practicing it myself (alongside
years of resenting having to play violin but that's unrelated).

We were interested in making new sheet music and the topic of asking chatGPT to
transcribe songs automatically for us came up. However, before asking, we had a
small discussion on whether or not we though it would work:

> A: what if u ask ai to make sheet for u? do u think it could do it
>
> B: no idea!!! probably? since it make normal code...
>
> A: thats because it has many examples to pull from! A: vp piano sheet music is
> pretty rare..
>
> B: just transformation of note.... transcription!
>
> A: u know how the ai works right, it just puts most likely things together,
> which is usually correct... outcome is to make sense instead of be right A:
> anyways thats why im interested in asking about vp!!!

Naturally, I'm doubting it while my friend is more optimistic. We decided to ask
it to transcribe Canon in C, which we already have sheet music for. Let's see
how it goes:

![asking chatgpt to make sheet music directly](/blobs/80/chatgpt1.png)

```txt
X: 1
T: Canon in D
C:Johann Pachelbel
M: 4/4
L: 1/8
K:D
|:A | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 |
| G2 G2 F2 E2 | F2 E2 D4 | A2 F2 D2 B,2 | C4 A2 A2 |
| D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 | D2 F2 A2 d3 | B2 A2 F2 E2 |
| G2 G2 F2 E2 | F2 E2 D4 | A2 F2 D2 B,2 | A4 |]
```

We opened with a direct question without any context - this didn't go too well.
The result is a `makefile` (what?), has the title "Canon in D", and the entire
thing doesn't make sense in the context of any virtual piano we were familiar
with. Our only guess is M is the time signature, 4/4 time, and the letter and
number combinations are note and octave values. I would later figure out what
this was, and it will be covered at the end.

How about we provide them with the first eight bars?

![providing the first eight bars](/blobs/80/chatgpt2.png)

```txt
3 5 2 1 0 2 3 5 | 2 4 0 1 7 0 6 5 |
1 0 2 3 5 3 2 1 | 4 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 |
```

Ok, now we get a series of numbers back, this seems more legitimate. What does
it sound like?

<video controls src="/blobs/80/attempt3.mp4" />

Unfortunately this is not correct either. If you're familiar with the key
layout, you can notice that the steps between `8` and `w` are much more than the
steps between `3` and `5`, suggesting this is incorrect without playing it.

Let's try again and give it more bars:

![providing more bars](/blobs/80/chatgpt3.png)

Those are the correct notes! But does it understand where the notes come from or
did it just repeat what we fed it? Let's ask it for more:

![asking for the next lines](/blobs/80/chatgpt4.png)

```txt
[8f] w t u [5d] 9 w r [6s] 0 e t [3a] 7 0 w
[4p] 8 q e [1o] 5 8 0 [4p] 8 q e [5a] 9 w r
[2o] y [8t] w [5r] 9 [6p] t [0o] 8 [9i] u [5y] t r
[2o] y [7r] w [4y] e [5r] 9 [1i] q e [2o] y [3a] w
```

It seems to have caught on to the format; could this be correct? Let's take a
listen!

<video controls src="/blobs/80/attempt4.mp4" />

It started out well (though the first two lines are copies of what was provided)
and then goes wrong. At least it doesn't sound too bad, if incorrect. Let's give
it more lines and see if it can figure things out:

![providing even more lines](/blobs/80/chatgpt5.png)
![telling it off for copying the lines we gave](/blobs/80/chatgpt6.png)

```txt
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
[2os] y [8ti] w [5tu] 9 [6yd] t [0wu] 8 [7ti] u [5wo] y r
```

Looks like it came up with a line and repeated it 3 times. The lines look like
they will sound similar to what it tried before `[2o] y` and `[2os] y`. This
doesn't look correct but let's listen...

<video controls src="/blobs/80/attempt5.mp4" />

![getting repeated answer](/blobs/80/chatgpt7.png)

Another attempt makes it repeat itself. Perhaps it decided to repeat itself when
it heard that Canon is repetitive? We've given up at this point so we instead
ask it if it is familiar with virtual piano, which it seems to not be.

![asking if its familiar with virtual piano](/blobs/80/chatgpt8.png)

Great, it finally admits it does not know what its doing. I'm also not sure what
the second paragraph is saying - was it generating a different notation that
software out there supports? Or was it telling us to find something that could
understand the virtual piano notation (under the assumption that we did not
understand the format ourselves?) I'm not sure.

But wait, what about the notation it showed us initially - what is that? A
search online shows that this is
[abc notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation). I'm unfamiliar with
this notation, but fortunately there are tools online that should be able to
generate sounds from this notation. And it sounds like...

<audio controls>
    <source src="/blobs/80/maybe-canon-in-d.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

:(. These questions were asked around September 29, 2023.

There are many possible arrangements for Canon in (key), but unfortunately
chatGPT was unable to provide any of them. The topic must be too niche for it to
have much data on to even create sheet music for a well known song. We were
planning to ask it to generate sheet music for various songs if it could handle
this, but that was not the case.

The full version of this sheet music is below, though there are many many other
versions that are valid. You can try playing it yourself, though I would not use
the autoplayer because it cannot handle tempo as well as a human playing -
spacing between notes and other symbols which I've omitted for simplicity play a
part in timing.

Here's a video of it; I've replaced spaces with periods because the autoplay
uses periods for longer pauses.

<video controls src="/blobs/80/full.mp4" />

Overall, this just reinforces my [position on ai](/posts/59) - if you're aiming
for correctness, you must double check the output because it can't be trusted.
Even though there are many stories and examples of ai generating code, solving
math problems, and performing other amazing feats, I just cannot bring myself to
blindly use it. In fact, this kind of sheet music generation can be
straightforward and logical by taking simple music files like MIDIs or existing
sheet music and doing a direct translation into virtual piano's notation. If
these LLMs are generating answers by learning rules and solving problems then
this should have been possible. Perhaps a very detailed explanation of the key
to sound mapping followed by questioning would work; it has not been tried yet.
