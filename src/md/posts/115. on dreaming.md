# on dreaming

Dreaming. I don't do it much, or at least I don't remember it when I wake up,
but last night I had a very calming experience.

I won't bother with the details but it ended/I woke up at a peaceful moment and
felt extremely relaxed.

Considering what I've been going through over the past few weeks, it was a much
needed reprieve; I literally thanked my mind for the dream when I awoke. It was
so impactful that I decided to write it down.

I considered extending this post by talking about things like lucid dreaming or
other sleep practices (none of which I do), but in the end I decided to keep
this short and sweet.
