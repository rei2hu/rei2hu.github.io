# dodging life bombs

When I look at recent events and the current state of things, I feel like I've
dodged many bombs through inaction (or even laziness!)

Of course, conversely, I have also missed many opportunities, and I can't truly
evaluate the value of things that didn't happen against things that actually
happened.

I will not elaborate.

There is the saying that the grass is greener on the other side, and maybe it
is, but I think I'm content with what I have for now. Or, you know, I'm too
risk-averse to make any big moves currently.

Who knows?

I do think what I've achieved so far with my relatively slow and risk free life
is a lofty goal for the average person.
