# framework troubleshooting

If your framework laptop is not powering on, I would suggest looking at
[this support page](https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/my-framework-laptop-intel-12th-gen-intel-core-is-not-powering-on-BJWtouV3q)
to start and messaging support.

Last Friday night, my framework laptop refused to power on. Uh-oh. I had an
assignment whose deadline was that Sunday and, with my only personal computer
dead, only had a phone... which I rarely use at all.

Furthermore, as a password manager user, I did not have access to most of my
accounts until I could get a computer with internet access to download a copy of
my database and the proper password management software to use it. Fortunately,
I do keep my most important passwords memorized and was able to reset the few
accounts I needed to access at that moment through my phone. Spoilers: I was
able to recover my laptop, but I think I could have moved to a new one without
much issue.

## actual troubleshooting

In addition to sending some messages off to the professor of the class whose
assignment's deadline I may just miss, I started searching online for any kind
of information, quickly coming across the knowledgebase article linked above and
following the steps.

> If your power button doesn't light up when pressed... Double check the
> Touchpad Cable that goes between the Touchpad and the Mainboard...

My power button was not lighting up, so I opened up the laptop and checked the
connection. It was fine.

> If your power button lights up briefly but then turns off...

No, the power button is not lighting up at all.

> If your power button lights up, but you don't see the screen come on, and the
> side LEDs are solid...

No...

> If your power button lights up, but you don't see the screen come on, and the
> side LEDs are blinking...

As I said, the power button just is not lighting up at all, and the remaining
steps assume that it should be. I decided to ignore the "If your power button
lights up" sentence in the headers. Both sections that don't troubleshoot the
light itself say to monitor the LED lights on the side 20 seconds or for 5
minutes after boot. While the entire laptop seemed dead, I went ahead and did it
anyways.

There was something - after 20 seconds of nothing; no power button light, no
monitor light, only a solid white LED light that probably indicates the charger
is plugged in - I saw the following:

> the side LEDs next to the Expansion Cards will blink out a code with the
> status of various subsystems/boot initialization steps.

Good progress. What were the colors?

Green, green, red, green, green, green, green, green, red, red, green, green,
orange, green, green, green, green, green, green, green, green. In other words:

| color  | system/code                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| green  | Battery connected check         |
| green  | Power Good 3V5V supply          |
| red    | Power Good VCCIN_AUX            |
| green  | CPU deassert sleep S4           |
| green  | Power boot core VR              |
| green  | Touchpad detected               |
| green  | Audio board Detected            |
| green  | Thermal sensor detected         |
| red    | Fan detected and spins up       |
| red    | CPU reached S0 state            |
| green  | DDR initialized OK              |
| green  | Internal display initialized OK |
| orange | post codes                      |
| green  | post bit 0                      |
| green  | post bit 1                      |
| green  | post bit 2                      |
| green  | post bit 3                      |
| green  | post bit 4                      |
| green  | post bit 5                      |
| green  | post bit 6                      |
| green  | post bit 7                      |

So no power good signal from vccin_aux, fan not detected, and cpu did not reach
S0 state. I'm no expert (or even beginner) when it comes to things like this,
but my guess was that the cpu was not starting due to some power/voltage issue.
I then decided to search online for people with similar issues.

I was lucky enough to come across
[this](https://community.frame.work/t/led-sequence-vccin-aux/31577) thread on
the framework forums where a few people have had the similar symptoms as I did,
but there was no real solution given. The only thing suggested was to
[reset the mainboard](https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Fully+Resetting+the+Mainboard+State/113)
which I did. It did not change anything.

After some more fruitless digging, I decided to engage support. I detailed
everything to them and they actually responded soon after despite it being late
on Friday. They asked for videos and pictures of everything, so I did that...
and then mentioned my upcoming deadlines and asked if I should just buy a new
mainboard instead. And did that without any response because, frankly, I was
freaking out. Eventually, I turned in for the day after making no progress and
had a restless night.

When I woke up, I tried my powering on the framework again... it worked. What? I
don't know what could have caused this but the two things that might have done
so are: leaving the charger unplugged overnight, having the laptop sit in a
relatively cold environment. Don't ask. I was able to knock out my Sunday
deadline assignment but the laptop croaked soon after; the screen froze and I
had to hold the power button to shut it off, only for it to not be able to power
back on.

I added these details in my messages with framework support, who had not
responded yet. I then looked at the LED lights again; instead of the previous
pattern, they gave a different colors this time:

| color  | system/code                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| green  | Battery connected check         |
| green  | Power Good 3V5V supply          |
| green  | Power Good VCCIN_AUX            |
| green  | CPU deassert sleep S4           |
| green  | Power boot core VR              |
| green  | Touchpad detected               |
| green  | Audio board Detected            |
| green  | Thermal sensor detected         |
| green  | Fan detected and spins up       |
| green  | CPU reached S0 state            |
| red    | DDR initialized OK              |
| green  | Internal display initialized OK |
| orange | post codes                      |
| green  | post bit 0                      |
| green  | post bit 1                      |
| blue   | post bit 2                      |
| blue   | post bit 3                      |
| green  | post bit 4                      |
| green  | post bit 5                      |
| blue   | post bit 6                      |
| green  | post bit 7                      |

An issue with DDR? The knowledgebase article actually has a section on potential
fixes for "DDR initialized OK"

I tried these steps but the laptop still refused to boot, and furthermore the
blinking LED started to blink the previous pattern with VCCIN_AUX and other
things being red. At this point, I sent support (which still had not responded
yet, though it was a weekend) an update and gave up for the day. I left the
laptop unplugged like last night in the hopes that I could recreate today's
scenario where I could boot it at least once.

You may be interested in the meaning of the post codes, and the main
resources/references I found were the links in
[this thread](https://community.frame.work/t/post-code-bits-meaning/11857). I
believe it was `0x4c DXE_VARIABLE_INIT_FAIL Fail to initial Variable Service`
whatever that means.

Next morning, I attempted to power the laptop back on; it did not work. However,
the LEDs had gone back to blinking out the "DDR initialized pattern". I also
received my first response from support overnight. It was prefaced with "We
understand that you may already performed some of this steps however, we just
want to make sure that nothing was missed.", and then told me to check that the
side LED lights and keyboard cable were properly attached, despite providing
them with videos of the LED light blinking before. Really, just the entire
knowledgebase article but I had been referencing but worded a little
differently. I was... pretty miffed. At the bottom of their response, they then
detailed the "DDR initialized OK" troubleshooting steps with the added step of
removing the SSD and expansion cards.

I went through it, and noticed that having RAM in only slot 0 would result in no
blinking LEDs while having RAM in both slots 1 and 0 would. I then tried
powering the laptop on with the SSD and only RAM in slot 0, and it worked! The
laptop was saved (though I can only use one stick of RAM and I'm not too sure
how stable it is, but it's been working fine for a few days so far).

In the meantime I updated support and asked them to cancel the mainboard order I
made, but they couldn't so I have to wait for it to be delivered and then send
it back. Furthermore, the tracking service they use, aftership, uses cloudflare
protection so...

![endless cloudflare verification loop](/blobs/129/cf.gif)

Endless verification loop! Very cool ~~framework~~ ~~aftership~~ cloudflare!

Jokes aside, I'm decently happy with how things turned out as a workaround was
found. Though at the end of the day, the VCCIN_AUX LED pattern was never truly
solved; it just happened to turn into a DRAM issue which was.
