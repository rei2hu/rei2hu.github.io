# a performance investigation of this site

I recently added a very simple bit of css to avoid blasting people's eyes when
they toggle light mode on:

```css
transition: background-color 1s ease-out;
```

It works quite well for my setup, but there is one small flaw which is that it
also applies when users initially load the page, so the background color
transitions from full-white to almost-white (the white I use for light mode).

This transition, while slight, made me realize there was some unreasonable lag
on loading the page and I opted to look into it. It must be that the new
transition is somehow extremely heavy right? I do have a lot of non-basic css
selectors so a repaint could be ruining things.

I'll skip ahead a bit and say that the lag is worst on a page like
[this one](/posts/14), and it wasn't css, it was existing javascript - I only
hadn't noticed it before because... I guess it wasn't too big of a deal. Or was
it? Let's look at what the profiler says

![profile of page load](/blobs/106/without-worker.png)

You can see the red bar showing parts where the UI is struggling to render
frames and there are almost 3 seconds of horrible lag caused by
[TikZJax](https://tikzjax.com/). Unfortunately I like the functionality and
don't really think there is a replacement for it. The closest thing would be
[HoLaTeX](https://holatex.app) but that actually uses a modified version of
TikZJax in the background based on some quick investigation and reverse
engineering.

Because there was no alternative, I opted to try modifying the package itself.
How would we make this more performant? By moving most of the work to a worker.

The source of TikZJax is not the cleanest, and it took me several hours to get a
proper build going, though that could also be related to the fact that I added
the built library 4 or 5 years ago and never updated it. The logic is comprised
of two main parts:

1. ... Pick parts of the dom to transform
2. Load tex and output dvi data for everything being transformed
3. Convert the output to svg using `dvi2html`
4. ... Replace the original dom bits

1, 2, and 4 can be easily seen and modified in the
[source](https://github.com/kisonecat/tikzjax) itself, but this single line
involving `dvi2html` contains most of the complexity (outside of the wasm logic)
and issues.

```js
let machine = await dvi2html(streamBuffer(), page);
```

[dvi2html](https://github.com/kisonecat/dvi2html) is a project by the same
author and is is basically a parser that does what it says it does. As a
foreword, I'll say that I'm not sure if these changes are correct or if I just
had trouble figuring out the dependencies and building the projects so I made
code changes instead. But I can say that the result works for me.

The first issue I came across was that there was no output. If you look a little
above, `streamBuffer()` is a generator, and deep down in the code there is a
line that checks its `length` which was undefined.

```js
async function* streamBuffer() {
    yield Buffer.from(dvi);
    return;
}

while(offset < buffer.length)
```

So the first change was to just put the buffer in place of the generator.

The second change I made was related to the text output, as I noticed none of my
diagrams had text on them. A comparison between the new and current outputs
showed that the new version was outputting `span` tags while the old one output
`text` tags.

Digging into the source yielded these lines:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```js
if (this.svgDepth == 0) {
	let space = "";
	if (this.lastTextV == this.position.v && left > this.lastTextRight + 2) {
		space =
			'<span style="display: inline-block; width: 0pt;">&nbsp;</span>';
	}

	this.writeToPage(
		`<span style="line-height: 0; color: ${this.color}; font-family: ${
			this.font.name
		}; font-size: ${fontsize}pt; position: absolute; top: ${
			top - height
		}pt; left: ${left}pt; overflow: visible;"><span style="margin-top: -${fontsize}pt; line-height: ${0}pt; height: ${fontsize}pt; display: inline-block; vertical-align: baseline; ">${space}${htmlText}</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: ${height}pt; height: ${0}pt; line-height: 0;"></span></span>\n`
	);
	this.lastTextV = this.position.v;
	this.lastTextRight = left + width;
} else {
	let bottom = this.position.v * this.pointsPerDviUnit;
	// No 'pt' on fontsize since those units are potentially scaled
	this.writeToPage(
		`<text alignment-baseline="baseline" y="${bottom}" x="${left}" style="font-family: ${this.font.name};" font-size="${fontsize}">${htmlText}</text>\n`
	);
}
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

For some reason, `this.svgDepth = 0` and the `span`s were being output. This
variable was only controlled by the methods `beginSVG()` and `endSVG()`

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```js
  beginSVG( ) {
    let left = this.position.h * this.pointsPerDviUnit;
    let top = this.position.v * this.pointsPerDviUnit;

    if (this.svgDepth == 0) {
      // FIXME: Should I have 0.99624in instead of 1in ?
      this.writeToPage( `<svg width="1in" height="1in" viewBox="0 0 72 72" style="position: absolute; top: 0pt; left: 0pt; overflow: visible;">\n` );
    }

    this.writeToPage( `<g transform="translate(${left},${top})">\n` );
    this.svgDepth += 1;
  }

  endSVG( ) {
    this.svgDepth -= 1;

    this.writeToPage( '</g>' );

    if (this.svgDepth == 0) {
      this.writeToPage( '</svg>' );
    }
  }
```

Which after some more investigation, were never being called. I ended up erasing
the `this.svgDepth === 0` case from the logic, which seems like a bad choice,
but made the text appear again.

The (I think) last update I made was to remove this new div that started
appearing because it made everything weirdly positioned.

```js
this.output.write(
	`<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: ${height}pt;" class="page">`
);
```

Finally, `dvi2html` works... Actually, I couldn't build it from source and ended
up modifying the built version in the `node_modules` folder of the `TikZJax`
project...

As for getting the worker in, I'm not going to bother with the details. It just
requires a refactoring to remove 1 and 4 which interact with the dom, then
setting up some worker/window thread logic.

And the result?

![profile of page load with worker](/blobs/106/with-worker.png)

It stops blocking the thread but now takes 3x longer. It could be related to a
lot of things like updating `dvi2html`, or the general refactor, or other
things. A good chunk is actually related to the initial load. Either way, I'm ok
with it though - I can just slap a simple css loading animation on them.

You may also wonder what the first chunk of javascript is; that's MathJax. I
don't think it's too big of an issue.

Well, I found a different version of `dvi2html` which contained all the relevant
fixes and other changes, rebuilt, and the performance is a lot better.
