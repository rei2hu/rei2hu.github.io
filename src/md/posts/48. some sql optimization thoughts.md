# some sql optimization thoughts

I was strictly in the "if you can do it in one query then do it in one query" camp
for a while, but when I couldn't get a pretty complex query with several joins
and aggregate functions to perform, I started doubting that saying.

After asking for some thoughts and reading some texts, my opinion has now turned
into the classic "it depends".

Also another thing I've learned is that you can improve aggregate functions by being
more specific sometimes. `count(table.primary_field)` vs `count(*)` can greatly
improve performance when joins are involved because it could lower table widths.
I think I remember hearing about being more specific in aggregate functions in university
but forgot about it.
