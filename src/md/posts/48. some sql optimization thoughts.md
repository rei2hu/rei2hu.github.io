# some sql optimization thoughts

I was strictly in the "if you can do it in one query then do it in one query"
camp for a while, but when I couldn't get a pretty complex query with several
joins and aggregate functions to perform, I started doubting that saying.

After asking for some thoughts and reading some texts, my opinion has now turned
into the classic "it depends".

Also another thing I've learned is that you can improve aggregate functions by
being more specific sometimes. `count(table.primary_field)` vs `count(*)` can
greatly improve performance when joins are involved because it could lower table
widths. I think I remember hearing about being more specific in aggregate
functions in university but forgot about it.

## kind of an update

I came across some articles mentioning that `count(*)` is as fast as or even
faster than its equivalents as it's a special case. I remembered that I wrote
something contradicting and looked back here to check. I wish I had recorded
more details about the specific queries I was looking at. My guess is that
everyone is talking about the actual execution of count, while I'm trying to
discuss how the `x` in `count(x)` can change the width of the rows in the
returned tables after a join, resulting in less memory io and a faster query?
