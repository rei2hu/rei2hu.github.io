# heroku go broku

A few weeks ago I received an email regarding Heroku discontinuing its free tier.
This is quite unfortunate as I think free services like Heroku are great for budding
developers. It used to be one of my suggestions for a hosting service when I was
helping people with their personal projects as you could get enough hours to run
something for the entire month and then some if you had a CC number. Weirdly enough
it did seem to get looked down upon by other experienced develpers in that community
because they would say "just get a vps from linode or digital ocean" etc etc without
understanding the context of what people were looking for, but that's a tangent.

Personally, I had my own project which has a couple thousand users that's been quietly
running for the past 5 or so using only free hours and a worker dyno. Unfortunately
it's going to shut down November 28th, which is when Heroku will wipe everything.
There are numerous alternatives for me to host it but I figure this is a nice time
to let that project truly die as I released the source long ago and haven't updated
it since.

Again, it's always sad to see a free service go, especially because of (I believe
in Heroku's case) abuse. A few bad people ruining things for the rest.
