# following up with bing chat about virtual piano

Sequel to [post 80](/posts/80) that was too long for an edit so I made it its
own post.

I would eventually follow up on my idea of providing the mappings manually with
bing chat, which I believe is powered by GPT-4 as hinted by the page title "Bing
Chat with GPT-4". It took several attempts to get to this stage, and my friend
and I both agreed that this was much better:

I've cut out most of the generated table, and the entire table was not
generated. It looked pretty good at a glance, though I've left in one part which
was wrong that I would not notice until later.

It gives a semi-valid reason for not providing the notes, as it says there is a
lot more to music than just the notes. Also this is the first time I start
getting a hint of a bug as the answer never ends but instead keeps repeating the
last few random lines until I make it stop. I then tried telling it to focus
only on notes and ignoring other parts of music:

What if I give it the notes and ask it to figure out the song?

<br />

At this point, I realized the mapping was incorrect. 8 should have been C3 but
instead was listed as D2, and I noticed 8 wasn't even in the table above because
it transitioned to the next row of keys after 7. I then decided to restart the
conversation to get the correct table:

I verified that what was marked down in the table was correct and continued
asking:

I spot checked a few notes above and they were all correct, so I decided to
proceed. Unfortunately, I wasn't too sure about how to proceed because "rhythm,
dynamics, and articulation" are not exactly part of virtual piano notation
(though rhythm technically is with certain rests), so I just decided to feed it
more notes:

And now going back to ask for the notes for the song rather than the song for
the notes:

![can you create notes for canon in c](/blobs/83/finalanswer1.png)
![repeated unrelated text](/blobs/83/finalanswer2.png)

So it's still not there. It was quite impressive that it was able to generate
the correct table of note to key - I think there is more than an LLM at work
here which is what allowed it to understand the concept of "61 keys in order of
left to right top to bottom on a qwerty keyboard". It could also be because it
experienced my various prompt attempts to get the correct answer, eventually got
it, and noted it down as correct once I didn't complain about the answer.

One issue I noticed was that it would happily assign a key not in the table a
note when it got the table wrong. And of course the other glaring issue which is
probably related to whatever layer sits in between gpt-4 and bing chat, though
that's most likely less on the AI/ML side.

These questions were asked around October 11, 2023 using bing chat's precision
mode.

But what if we try to break the steps up:

There is an issue here where it says r = D4, though when putting together the
initial mapping it knew r = b3. The keyboard notes are wrong. The actual notes
translate into something like

```txt
y p a G h d h j a G h d h j d o y o p a G k f k L V b x b k f j f j k
```

which doesn't sound accurate so the actual "simple arrangement" is no good in my
opinion. Let's switch to song number 2: twinkle twinkle little star. After
opening with the key mapping prompt and verifying it knows what it is:

This is correct (in a sense). The `8`s should be replaced with `1`s or the
entire song needs to be shifted upwards an octave, but the tones themselves are
correct.

<br />

And this is no longer twinkle twinkle little star. Breaking things up into
individual steps to get around limitations was a good idea, but at the end of
the day I don't think bing chat truly understands the concepts behind the key to
note mapping and its relation to music, which cause it to ultimately fail.
