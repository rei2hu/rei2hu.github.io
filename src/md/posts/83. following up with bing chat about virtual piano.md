# following up with bing chat about virtual piano

Sequel to [post 80](/posts/80) that was too long for an edit so I made it its
own post.

I would eventually follow up on my idea of providing the mappings manually with
bing chat, which I believe is powered by GPT-4 as hinted by the page title "Bing
Chat with GPT-4". It took several attempts to get to this stage, and my friend
and I both agreed that this was much better:

I've cut out most of the generated table, and the entire table was not
generated. It looked pretty good at a glance, though I've left in one part which
was wrong that I would not notice until later.

It gives a semi-valid reason for not providing the notes, as it says there is a
lot more to music than just the notes. Also this is the first time I start
getting a hint of a bug as the answer never ends but instead keeps repeating the
last few random lines until I make it stop. I then tried telling it to focus
only on notes and ignoring other parts of music:

What if I give it the notes and ask it to figure out the song?

<br />

At this point, I realized the mapping was incorrect. 8 should have been C3 but
instead was listed as D2, and I noticed 8 wasn't even in the table above because
it transitioned to the next row of keys after 7. I then decided to restart the
conversation to get the correct table:

I verified that what was marked down in the table was correct and continued
asking:

I spot checked a few notes above and they were all correct, so I decided to
proceed. Unfortunately, I wasn't too sure about how to proceed because "rhythm,
dynamics, and articulation" are not exactly part of virtual piano notation
(though rhythm technically is with certain rests), so I just decided to feed it
more notes:

And now going back to ask for the notes for the song rather than the song for
the notes:

![can you create notes for canon in c](/blobs/83/finalanswer1.png)
![repeated unrelated text](/blobs/83/finalanswer2.png)

So it's still not there. It was quite impressive that it was able to generate
the correct table of note to key, though one issue would be that it happily
assigned a key not in the table a note when it got the table wrong. And of
course the other glaring issue which is probably related to whatever layer sits
in between gpt-4 and bing chat.

These questions were asked around October 11, 2023 using bing chat's precision
mode.
