# complaining about the next generation

I see a lot of discourse online about how today's teenagers and early 20s
(relative to the date of the post) act quite disrespectfully and unhinged. I
also see a lot of discussion on how many are unmotivated and lazy.

And I admit that I feel the same.

I think back to the comments I received when I was younger; the adults back then
also commented on my "poor behaviour" and "lack of work ethic". I would disagree
with the behaviour assessment unless being reserved was interpreted as being
disrespectful, but I would agree that I was definitely less proactive before.

But is that sense of disappointment from the previous generation the same as the
sense of disappointment that I feel towards the next generation?

It's tough to say. While I believe there may always be some level of superiority
in attitude between generations, I think there has been a significant shift in
values in the most recent generations (not including mine, of course!) which
leads to a larger gap.

Mainly related to the monetization of attention and everything that implies.
Exponential decline, really - it may have been happening in the previous
generations but becomes more apparent the further it goes.

Or I've finally become a bitter old man.
