# a weird cpp error

Const reference good.

I came across an interesting problem when doing a programming project for my
hpc (high-performance computing) class. Take a look at the following distilled
example:

```cpp
std::map<int, std::vector<data_t>> data_for_cpu;
// ... vectors are filled and whatnot

std::vector<MPI_Request> requests;
for (auto [dest, vec]: data_for_cpu) {
    MPI_Request req;
    MPI_ISend(&vec[0], vec.size(), MPI_DATA_T, dest, comm, &req);
    reqs.push_back(req);
}

for (int i = 0; i < reqs.size(); i++) {
    MPI_Status status;
    MPI_Probe(MPI_ANY_SOURCE, 0, comm, &status);

    int incoming_size;
    MPI_Get_count(&status, MPI_DOUBLE, &incoming_size);

    data_t* data = new data_t[incoming_size];
    MPI_Recv(data, incoming_size, MPI_DATA_T, status.MPI_SOURCE, 0, comm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);

    for (int i = 0; i < incoming_size; i++) {
        // do something with data[i];
    }
}

MPI_Waitall(reqs.size(), &reqs[0], MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE);
```

First, some info on what MPI and the calls are doing:

- MPI is short for message passing interface and is used for writing message
  passing programs. In this case, we are sending data between multiple processes
  (processors).
- `MPI_ISend` is a non-blocking send.
- `MPI_Recv` is a blocking receive.
- `MPI_Probe` and `MPI_Get_count` is used to get the size of the incoming
  messages dynamically.
- The same program is run on all processors, so each processor is calculating
  some data, and sending it to others. `vec` contains the information being sent
  and `data` will hold the incoming information.

If we add some prints, we can track what's being sent:

```cpp
    for (auto d : vec)
        std::cout << rank << " sends " << d << " to " << status.MPI_SOURCE << std::endl;
    MPI_ISend(&vec[0], vec.size(), MPI_DATA_T, dest, comm, &req);
    reqs.push_back(req);

    // ...

    for (int i = 0; i < incoming_size; i++) {
        std::cout << rank << " gets " << data[i]
            << " from " << status.MPI_SOURCE << std::endl;
    }
```

What does this print? Something like

```txt
0 sends 1 to 1
1 sends 1 to 0
0 sends 2 to 1
1 sends 2 to 0
0 sends 3 to 1
0 gets 1 from 1
0 gets 2 from 1
1 sends 3 to 0
1 gets 1 from 0
0 gets 3 from 1
1 gets 2 from 0
1 gets 3 from 0
```

Of course it'll be mixed up as that's the nature of basic logging and parallel
programming, but if you split it to two streams then you can see what's
happening more clearly.

```txt
0 sends 1 to 1    1 sends 1 to 0
0 sends 2 to 1    1 sends 2 to 0
0 sends 3 to 1    1 sends 3 to 0
0 gets 1 from 1   1 gets 1 from 0
0 gets 2 from 1   1 gets 2 from 0
0 gets 3 from 1   1 gets 3 from 0
```

But what I noticed for a specific scenario was this happening:

```txt
0 sends 1 to 1    1 sends 1 to 0
0 sends 2 to 1    1 sends 2 to 0
0 sends 3 to 1    1 sends 3 to 0
0 gets 1 from 1   1 gets 0 from 0 // 1 gets 0 instead of 1 now
0 gets 2 from 1   1 gets 2 from 0
0 gets 3 from 1   1 gets 3 from 0
```

It would only occur when the program was run on the cluster, and not when
running it locally. It always happened in one specific case. What could be the
issue?

I can't say much in terms of how I figured out the issue, because I didn't
really do so. Instead, after hours of throwing things at the wall, I found out
that changing the loop to use const references avoided the problem.

```cpp
for (auto const &[dest, vec]: data_for_cpu) {
```

Because this change seemed to resolve the issue, I assume the compiler or
something else was making a copy of the data for the loop body and cleaning it
up before `MPI_ISend` actually sent the message. Is that the actual case? I
don't know! It's a little weak based on what I think I know - namely that the
memory wouldn't be 0'd out even if it was "cleaned up", since that would take
extra cycles. Unless that's a c++ thing.

It is something that I could probably spend some more time looking into, but the
project still has a lot to go and I'll be focusing on that. I guess it also goes
to show that const'ing everything that can be const'd is probably a good idea,
not only in c++ but also in other languages.
