# factorio - gleba

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->

It's been a stressful month. (Almost) failed midterms, failed interviews,
~~possible depression of not being good enough~~, falling behind schedules... I
think I would have lost my mind if it wasn't for weekly game nights with some
long time friends. Thank you internet for connecting me with these people over a
decade ago.

Anyways, I'm not here to talk about that; I would like to talk about Factorio. I
remember writing a small piece on Factorio a year back and we were playing with
the Space Exploration mod. With the Space Age expansion being released a couple
of weeks ago, I have spent a lot of my free time on a new game with friends and
had the honor of setting up a base on Gleba.

If you're unfamiliar with the game, the core gameplay loop is automation,
optimization, and scaling. Technically you don't need to automate anything but
then progression is very slow. Anyways, once you do scale to certain sizes, you
can then start from (basically) scratch on new planets which offer new
resources. Gleba is one of them.

I'll start off with a list of problems that had to be solved to get the factory
up, running, and self-sustaining.

1. I'm not getting enough seeds back to replant my trees! How can I fix that?

    - Biochambers have an innate 50% productivity bonus. A tree gives 50 fruit
      and each fruit has a base 2% chance to give a seed. That's not much chance
      to have a seed surplus to scale your farms, so make sure to use them. Also
      clean up any excess seeds. (biochamber with productivity bonus image)

2. How do I structure my factory around nutrients?

    - Every biochamber needs a nutrient and spoilage line, so why not combine
      them into one? This means a biochamber needs access to at least 3 belts
      typically: a nutrition/spoilage belt, an input items belt (typically
      bioflux and other), and an output items belt. Sometimes you may only need
      the nutrient and/or one other belt so plan ahead.

        I would suggest a large cyclical belt that snakes throughout the entire
        factory for this purpose.

        A single line also means that removing spoilage can be done at any
        point. Burned in a heat tower or converted back into nutrients.

3. How do I make sure I don't run out of nutrients?

    - There are two ways to do this, some recipes produce nutrients and can then
      pick up their own production to power themselves, guaranteeing infinite
      nutrients as long as their input is satisfied and belt is not clogged.

    I also like to include a single assembly machine for processing yumako and
    one biochamber doing the yumako to nutrient recipe just in case - as long as
    this biochamber doesn't run out of nutrients, it can bootstrap the entire
    factory (and you could add more to avoid a single point of failure...)

4. How can I deal with pentapod eggs hatching?

    - Produce them but don't stockpile them. At the end of their belt,
      incinerate them in a heat tower. Any machine that needs eggs can pick them
      up earlier in the belt.

5. How can I defend against stompers?

    - Stomper defense is pretty tough. They ignore walls which means they will
      easily get on top of your defenses if there isn't much burst damage. If
      you use weapons requiring constant input like lasers or flamethrowers,
      they're useless once power poles or pipes are broken.

        Instead use rocket and gun turrets.

        Alternatively, abuse the AI and set up some decoy turrets for the
        stompers to focus on. Laser turrets and flamethrower turrets have the
        most health at 1000 and 1400, but I find laser turrets easier to
        automate.

Enjoy some images of learning the defense lesson while on the job. It's hard to
see but those are stompers walking over the main base.
