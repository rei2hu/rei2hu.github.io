# i am a master

Is that what people with master's degrees call themselves? People with
doctorates get called doctor and have a dr. prefix, so surely people with
masters' can call themselves masters and have a... mr... prefix... That's what
mr. stands for, right? Master?

All jokes aside, I feel quite accomplished; I set my mind (and money) to a one
year commitment and was able to follow through. Technically I haven't graduated
yet since there are 3 weeks left, but I have high enough scores in my current
class to pass without doing anything else.

The real question is if I'll keep grinding for A's this semester, lean back and
relax, or make some half-assed effort to finish the remaining assignments. Who
knows?
