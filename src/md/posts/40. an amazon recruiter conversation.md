# an amazon recruiter conversation

*Email names/wording are modified for privacy*

Recently I received an email from an Amazon recruiter out of the blue.

> My name is R, and I am an Engineering Recruiter for Amazon’s Amazon Web Services
> (AWS).  After reading through your profile, I wanted to reach out to you today.
> Today I am reaching out because I’m looking for Software Development Engineer
> (SDE)’s for various locations.
>
> We have pre-scheduled interview slots that are coming up, and as I read through
> your profile, I wanted to make sure you were considered for one of our opportunities.
> If you are interested in learning more about some of these opportunities, I’d
> like to move you to our next step of the process.  Please let me know if you are
> interested.
>
> I appreciate your time, and I do hope to hear back from you.  Please let me know
> if you have any questions.  Thanks!

The first thing that caught my attention is that I have an actual profile out there
and that this was sent to a specific email that I used several years ago. The significance
of the email is that I use many emails set up in a tree like structure, such that
all emails are forwarded to the root email, I create new emails that forward to
the root and periodically nest the tree under a new root email. This means I have
a general idea of where someone got an email based on the receiver - in this case
the email was from a few years ago and job search related, interesting.

Furthermore, I (kind of) meticulously scrub my data after my search is finished
which technically should leave no information online anymore, but as we all know
it's still out there somewhere and I was curious to know where so I could delete
it.

Another thing I noted is that this message used two spaces after every period, which
suggested that it was manually typed up by an older person and not a template. I
also took the liberty of looking up the recruiter on LinkedIn and it looks like
he's been doing technical recruiting for a couple decades but moved to at Amazon
recently.

Also, the email was sent at around 12am west coast time. I figure he's trying to
meet some kind of deadline for filling up the candidate pipeline and I might as well
see if I can help somehow even if I'm not really interested.

Because of these things, and the fact that I'm pretty starved socially (maybe enough
to try to start a casual conversation with a *recruiter*, see previous posts), I
decided to respond.

> Thanks for reaching out. I'm not actively looking for a new position at the moment
> but might be interested in a change under the right circumstances. Any information
> about the opportunities would be greatly appreciated.
>
> My only specific question at the moment is what profile did you read?

The response:

> Thanks for the response.  I saw both profile in a job site, and also looking at
> an old resume of yours.  Based on that, made me want to try and reach out. Wasn’t

> If you have gone the SDE path, and you feel there is a fit and interest, let me

Hmm, unfortunately no specific info on where the profile is, but what I did learn
is that Amazon somehow has one of my old resumes on file. I don't remember applying
for any jobs at Amazon before so I went to look at any past emails. Turns out I
had another Amazon recruiter contact me a few years back.

Decided to look at this person's LinkedIn now, and it looks like they've since moved
from Amazon and are now a sr techincal recruiter at Facebook. The interesting thing
here is that he was asking for a resume, and I never responded - so I don't think
this is how Amazon picked up one of my old resumes. So then where did they get it?
Privacy leak nightmare, I suppose - most job search websites seem to be extremely
shady and spam you with "job" opportunities; I wouldn't be surprised if they sold
my resume.

Anyways, back to the recent recruiter, here's a the job description in case it ever
changed or the url dies:

"Join our team as we build brand-new solutions for smart energy, unlocking the potential
of machine learning and IoT to meet the demands of tomorrow’s net carbon zero
market." Hmm, yes, pitching a job related to the environment is a good way to hook
zoomers i.e. me, I guess. Unfortunately I failed to see the connection between AWS
and this and mentioned so in my response. I assumed it was like professional/managed
services for energy sector customers. I don't really know much of AWS outside of
the fact that it provides computing resources/platforms.

Before sending this response, I already erred towards not going for the opportunity
as it seemed like too much of a hastle for a small bump in compensation for a lot
lower quality of life and the actual work was still unclear. For these reasons,
I decided to lay out my hand with the full disclosure sentence.

Well, I think I showed too much and the recruiter never responded. Which kind of
sucks because I wanted to talk to someone at AWS and ask why it's so hard to figure
out a list of services you're running before you get billed, especially when one
of the core values is Customer Obsessed. Let's be honest, it's because they make
more money this way. In fact, based on my experience, maybe people are happier when
they ask for and get the refund compared to never having to ask for it in the first
place - creating fake friction which they can easily solve. And then there would
be people who are (over)billed and say nothing.
