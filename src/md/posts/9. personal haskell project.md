# personal haskell project

It just so happens that I finished `learnyouahaskell` a while back and have
started on a simple project to practice Haskell. I'm basically using `gloss` to
do all the graphics and event loop hard work so I can focus on writing Haskell
instead of dealing with all the internals of a game. Oh right, it's a game.

The funny thing is when I started out, I actually did use a few things I've
learned from `learnyouahaskell` like this:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```hs
getTiles :: Game -> [(OffsetCoords, Color)]
getTiles (Game _ t)= Map.foldr (\a b -> ((,) <$> Tile.positionOf <*> Tile.colorOf $ a):b) [] t

-- and even more scary
hasDarkNghbr :: Tile -> TileMap -> Bool
hasDarkNghbr (Tile (x, y) _) ts = let pred (Just (Tile _ (_, _, _, k))) = k > 0.5
                                      pred Nothing = True
                                  in any pred $ zipWith (uncurry nghbr) (zip [1..6] (replicate 6 ts)) (replicate 6 (x, y))
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

It's cool and functional and all but then I realized that zip/curry part is
really a consequence of having the arguments lined up pretty badly for the nghbr
function. By changing the order of the arguments

```hs
nghbr :: Int -> TileMap -> OffsetCoords -> Maybe Tile
-- to
nghbr :: TileMap -> OffsetCoords -> Int -> Maybe Tile
```

I was able to simplify that line to:

```hs
in any pred $ fmap (nghbr ts p) [1..6]
```

I'm using `fmap` just to avoid a name clash with Data.Map.Strict.map. Well I
mean I could've done it the right way but yeah. So far, I'm really enjoying
writing this since most functions are just a few lines and quick to write
despite doing a lot. I think the game is coming across quite nicely.
