# figured out I have a facebook

I was taking a look at some old emails and realized I never deleted a Facebook
account I made several years ago. I took the liberty of logging in to delete it.

For some info, I had <10 friends, posts, and photos (my 1 photo was actually just
a solid color used for my profile picture). Before deleting it, I took the liberty
of looking at my suggested friends as it caught my eye at the time.

I think the accuracy was quite good for such little information, however it mainly
suggested people from high school, and over 50% of the friends I had added were
from my high school so that's probably where the accuracy came from. It also suggested
a lot of people I did not recognize, though - some with which I have no mutual friends
with.

I'm not sure what to think of it, however, hopefully, I can rest with the fact that
my account will be deleted by the end of next month. It's quite unfortunate that
Facebook has its track record regarding privacy, because I can see how useful it
is for keeping up with others, which is the main reason I was going backwards through
my emails anyways - to find people to talk to.

Then again, I guess various email service providers also "read" your email, too.
Privacy truly is a losing battle. Well, I can at least kind of rest knowing that
attempts at searching my real name and various details turn up minimum information.
