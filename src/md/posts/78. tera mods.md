# tera mods

So recently I've been playing on Menma's TERA with dxvk as a performance boost.
When playing a game like TERA, it's useful to have tools that can give you
detailed information on your in-game performance like DPS meters. For TERA, this
comes in the form of ShinraMeter, which basically intercepts packets between the
game and you to record various statistics of your in-game actions.

The only issue with this program is that it's UI is external, and using dxvk (in
my case) forces the game window to stay on top. Also it requires installing
packet inspection drivers and whatnot which is kind of a pain.

Fortunately, for a while, some developers ended up being able to proxy the game
connection which allows for a lot of quality of life (and more controversial)
mods. This has since been packaged into a nice mod loader called tera-toolbox.
So with this in mind, I thought I'd try writing a simple dps report kind of mod.

Navigating to the [repository](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox)
greets you with:

Ignoring the fact that most of this is filled with TBD and hasn't been updated
for years, the actual specifics are lacking. Fortunately, for the simplest
functionality, not much has to be done except for intercepting the correct
packets via `mod.hook`, and I'm pretty familiar with how things work due to
experience on other games.

The big missing chunk of documentation revolves around the
[Querying Data from the Game Client's DataCenter](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox/blob/master/doc/mod/client-interface.md#querying-data-from-the-game-clients-datacenter-tbd-further-documentation)
functionality. I was looking to transform ids into names and fortunately there
was an example that does exactly what I wanted to there.

```js
mod.hook("S_SPAWN_NPC", 11, (event) => {
	// Note: you can also use async/await here, obviously
	mod.queryData("/StrSheet_Creature/HuntingZone@id=?/String@templateId=?", [
		event.huntingZoneId,
		event.templateId,
	]).then((result) => {
		mod.log(
			`Spawned NPC "${result.attributes.name}" (${event.huntingZoneId},${event.templateId})!`
		);
	});
});
```

Where does that string passed to `queryData` come from? It's not explained
anywhere but after some sleuthing, I eventually figured out that it had to do
with an unpacked version of `Client/S1Game/S1Data/DataCenter_Final_x.dat`. There
are various unpackers online, but in short it seems to contain multiple files,
one of which is called StrSheet_Creature and contains data like

```json
"HuntingZone": [
		{
			"id": 0,
			"String": [
				{
					"name": "Human Male Warrior",
					"templateId": 10101,
```

I still don't know how the syntax for the query itself works, though. Anyways, I
ended up trying to fetch npc names like

```js
mod.hook('S_SPAWN_NPC', 12, async ({ huntingZoneId, templateId }) => {
    const result = await mod.queryData(...);
    mod.log(result.attributes.name);
});
```

By following the example and the latest `S_SPAWN_NPC` definition, and it didn't
work. I also started getting some out of bounds error from, I believe, the
packet parser. I then tried copying the example verbatim and it worked. The
difference? The packet version number. However, sometimes it just doesn't work
(the query returns null) and I have no idea why - the values look correct and
there is a corresponding entry in the data files.

As for the UI, currently I only have it sending a message in chat after the
fight but I have some ideas to hijack some in-game UI for display purposes.
We'll see!

It didn't work out. In short, I knew that TERA had a built-in dps meter which
can be seen when accessing the training grounds, and I looked for a way to
leverage that.

A few hours of testing later and all I learned was that it relied directly on
the same packets I was intercepting i.e. `S_EACH_SKILL_RESULT` and did all the
calculations client side. I figured this out by blocking the packets, which made
the client think nothing was happening and consequently made it not update that
dps meter.

```js
mod.hook("S_EACH_SKILL_RESULT", 14, () => false);
```

I made no progress with figuring out how to make it show up outside the training
dungeon, and I was not too invested in this path forward so didn't bother
disassembling the client to figure out more.

At the end of the day, I just went through existing packets and found one called
`S_CUSTOM_STYLE_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` which could open a textarea like thing which
worked well enough for a custom UI section when called on an interval.

```js
mod.send("S_CUSTOM_STYLE_SYSTEM_MESSAGE", 1, {
	style: 49, // box on side of window
	message: dpsInfo.map((info) => formatDpsInfo(info)).join("\n"),
});
```

It does flash now and then because it's not meant to stay up there permanently,
though I'm not sure what the reason is as the interval should be short enough to
keep it on screen permanently.
