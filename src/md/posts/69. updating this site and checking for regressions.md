# updating this site and checking for regressions

Recently I've been pretty keen on making some small updates to this website;
just some small design things here and there, which we can guess at in the

That's a decent amount of commits in two days... and that spelling...! And all
the "fix..." things...! Let's take a look at how I could've caught some of these
issues and the cause of others. The first thing to know is that the website can
be built locally, and the output should be the exact same as what is built for
the web, as it uses the same command but just moves the files into the root
working directory.

Because of this, we can look at the generated content of the website for any
changes - a change in output suggests a change in the layout, and that layout
might be messed up. Let's pull the commit hash of the first change, which is
`86ce4b124ee05943b3ffb5e08eda887114122c9f`. We can compare it with it's
neighboring state by running `git diff hash hash^1`, but quickly run into a
problem where, due to things being minimized to a few lines, the diff is kind of
useless. Fortunately, we can improve things with `--word-diff` option, which
will be better. Unfortunately there's no support for word diff in the syntax
highlighting processor I'm using, so I've made small changes to make it
highlight nicely.

We can see the addition of same html tags, a change in the noscript warning
text, and an added light switch - all which are covered by changes in the
related internal commit. All _looks_ good, but once we get to the puzzles
directory, we see an issue:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Our table is no longer being converted nicely from markdown! I eventually
figured out this was due to the `:-:` in the table, which I guess is interpreted
as an emoji even though I have emojis disabled. And this was due to the
linter/formatter formatting the table!

```diff
- |  n\t  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

```

I ended up fixing it in the commit `079b7d1`, incorrectly attributing it to a
package update I did later. But I'm not going to reword that commit because I
don't care too much!

Let's look now at `684cc42a1957cfff1839be1c69efa929b7cff183`, the build of the
commit where I updated packages - I assume this is also the cause of a different
issue I've recently come across, where an image [here](/puzzles/4) was not
displaying properly, but I'm not sure if this is the cause.

Well I just looked through it and it's not, so instead we'll check the history
of the file with `git log`; unfortunately I don't think `git blame` will be
useful as it's squished to one line - this could be avoided by keeping a
non-minified version to compare against but too bad!

There is also `git bisect` which would probably lead me to an answer more
easily, but let's guess. We are looking for
`<img loading=lazy src=/blobs/4/dptable.png alt=dptable>`, and once we find a
commit without it, then we know something happened. As we do a improv semi
binary search starting from the creation of the file and the "update a lot of
packages" commit, we see that it has been like this weeks ago and was actually
changed in commit `2c20a3f0729b1630fc977dfe0111bda298737de8`, whose internal
commit is `c7e0e02cf966a1ac14720b96249aaca16676e9f4`. It just so happens it was
also built to include changes in the previous commit,
`204bc51955ef1ed4bcf4cd74e4eabed44ea07a6b` aka "change img to markdown img
tags". That sounds like the likely culprit and most likely is. In this case, for
some reason, markdown images in `<p>` tags were not converted properly, so I
extracted it.

Let me give a quick rundown of the other "fix" commits.

1. 2023-01-23 `8331be1` fix template navs if nothing before
    - This was a style update which caused the navigation above and below to hug
      left if there was only one.
2. 2023-01-23 `190f9e9` fix script
    - I updated the checkbox above code blocks to use a label instead of a span;
      part of a script which determined if code blocks needed an expand/collapse
      toggle had the span inside the selector to find code blocks so it no
      longer worked.
3. 2023-01-24 `3f11da0` fix style for small codeblocks
    - Same as above, but some selectors in css.
4. 2023-01-25 `74db445` fix 404 script
    - I thought `window.location.hash` included the "#".

And now that I'm using nested bullet points and see it coming out as a flat
list, there's something else that needs investigating... It seems to be around 2
vs 4 spaces for the list, but since I seem to always use numbers with nested
bullet points that works.

Heh, in the meantime I saw that [this post](/posts/21) has a ton of > due to me
messing up some mdlint ignore comments.

So yes, with a little diligence I could have avoided most issues, but since this
is my personal website and personal project, I do take liberties. Overall I'd
say it's decent.
