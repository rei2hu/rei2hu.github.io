## Question 1

What is the running time of the median finding algorithm if you break up the list
into $n/3$ groups of 3.
<br />
<br />
What about $n/7$ groups of 7?
<br />
<br />
First, a quick refreshed on how the median finding algorithm works normally:

1. Break list into groups of 5.
2. Sort groups
3. Get median of each group and put together into another list
4. Let the pivot be the median of the list from 3, which is found by recursively
   applying the formula
5. Partition list from 1 using the pivot
6. Recursively apply formula on single partition depending on which one contains
   the index of the median

What is it with 5? Let's look at the runtime of each step:

1. $O(n)$
2. $n * O(1) \Rightarrow O(n)$
3. $n * O(1) \Rightarrow O(n)$
4. $T(n / 5)$
5. $O(n)$
6. $T(3n / 4)$

The final equation is something like $T(3n / 4) + T(n / 5) + O(n)$ which is $O(n)$.
Breaking the groups into different sizes changes the runtime of steps 4 and 7. If
we do break into groups of 3, the runtime turns into something like
$T(n / 3) + T(2n / 3) + O(n)$ which doesn't really cut the cases down (through
the master theorem it looks to be $O(nlogn)$). Using groups of 7, the equation is
$T(n / 7) + T(5n / 7) + O(n)$ which reduces down to $O(n)$.
