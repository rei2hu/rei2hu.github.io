# 5 letter words that made of 25 distinct letters

A colleague shared a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w)
titled "Can you find: five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters?"

In short, given a list of 5 letter words, find 5 of them which do not have any repeating
letters. [This](https://gist.github.com/rei2hu/ffa463d49a67f1b20131a84e12fa0924)
was the word list that he provided for testing (althoug `wc -l` on my local file
gives me 12973 lines so maybe not but I was too lazy to move the file off a work
computer to local then upload it).

My colleague pointed out that there are solutions that took up to a month and down
to approximately 20 minutes while he has solutions that take 10 minutes and then
70 seconds with some data specific tricks which is quite interesting. If you watch
the video, you'll note that the "good" solution relies on graph theory which seemed
overly complex in my opinion.

My attempt at a solution is:

```js
const seen = new Set();
const words = require("fs").readFileSync(process.argv[2], "utf8")
    .split("\n")
    .filter(word => new Set(word).size === 5) // unique letters
    .filter(word => { // anagrams
        const sorted = word.split("").sort().join("");
        if (seen.has(sorted)) return false;
        seen.add(sorted);
        return true;
    });
console.log(words.length);

const failures = new Set();
function solve(selected, pos) {
    if (selected.length === 5) return selected;

    const letters = selected.join("").split("").sort().join("");
    if (failures.has(letters)) return;

    const cs = new Set(letters);

    outer:
    for (let i = pos; i < words.length; i++) {
        const word = words[i];
        for (const c of word) if (cs.has(c)) continue outer;

        const ans = solve([word, ...selected], i + 1);
        if (ans) return ans;
    }
    failures.add(letters);
}

const ans = solve([], 0);
console.log(ans);
```

It is a straightforward solution that takes around 100 seconds according to `time`;
a brute force search that prunes branches based on combinations already tried. Then
I realized the youtube video's uploader used a different word list which could be
found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt)
and instead listed all of the possible solutions.

So a small modification gives

```js
const seen = new Set();
const words = require("fs").readFileSync(process.argv[2], "utf8")
    .split("\n")
    .filter(word => new Set(word).size === 5 && word.length === 5) // unique letters
    .filter(word => { // anagrams
        const sorted = word.split("").sort().join("");
        if (seen.has(sorted)) return false;
        seen.add(sorted);
        return true;
    });
console.log(words.length);

const failures = new Set();
const a = [];
function solve(selected, pos) {
    if (selected.length === 5) {
        a.push(selected);
        return true;
    }

    const letters = selected.join("").split("").sort().join("");
    if (failures.has(letters)) return;

    const cs = new Set(letters);
    let good = false;

    outer:
    for (let i = pos; i < words.length; i++) {
        const word = words[i];
        for (const c of word) if (cs.has(c)) continue outer;

        good = good || solve([word, ...selected], i + 1);
    }
    if (!good) failures.add(letters);
    return good;
}

solve([], 0);
console.log(a, a.length);
```

Which takes around 5 minutes and returns 181 solutions. But in the video it says
we should have 831 solutions or 538 which is quite suspicious. Well, I saw at least
one issue around the short circuiting `good = good || solve(...)` as once one successful
set is found it wouldn't try the rest of the words. This only brought it up to 303
solutions after 5 minutes (interesting how the runtime didn't change much, but it
may be due to other background work I'm doing.) I do wish that the solution set
was provided somewhere to test against but unfortunately it's not.

One thing is to note that the efficient solution provided by the video revolves around
graph theory and is much more complex than this. However my "solution" may not even
be one. The interesting thing here is that the memory and runtime bounds on some
lines in my code are actually constant; the `failures` `Set` is actually constant
memory, as there is a finite number of 5-25 letter combinations in sorted order
(and we only store combinations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). That sorting? also constant
as we sort at most 25 letters. This is like a $O(n^5)$ solution with basic branch
pruning.

By the way, the trick my colleague used was to keep track of how many vowels were
in words and work off of that it works great for normal words but not fully randomized
data. But as I pointed out, it turns out the words were actually from somewhere else.
Either way, after processing, both lists were approximately 5000 words long.

Perhaps my entire thing is wrong, but I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader.

And a random revelation I had is that after the filtering process, the solution
is constant time as there is a finite amount of 5 letter words made up of distinct
letters.
