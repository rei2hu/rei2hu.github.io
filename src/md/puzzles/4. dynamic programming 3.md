## Question 1

<p>
A certain string-processing language offers a primitive operation which splits a
string into two pieces. Since this operation involves copying the original string,
it takes $n$ units of time for a string of length $n$, regardless of the location
of the cut. Suppose, now, that you want to break a string into many pieces. The order
in which the breaks are made can affect the total running time. For example, if
you want to cut a 20-character string at positions 3 and 10, then making the first
cut at position 3 incurs a total cost of 20 + 17 = 37, while doing position 10 first
has a better cost of 20 + 10 = 30.
<br />
<br />
Give a dynamic programming algorithm that, given the locations of $m$ cuts in a string
of length $n$, finds the minimum cost of breaking the string into $m + 1$ pieces.
<br />
<br />
So, I can't think of a formula off the top of my head, and I'm not fully sure how
the tree (I assume it's a tree approach) will look. However, let's try working the
problem backwards; we have $m + 1$ substrings in order and we want to join them together
while minimizing this cost. The cost to join 2 substrings $m_i$ and $m_{i + 1}$ is
$\text{len}(m_i) + \text{len}(m_{i + 1})$. In this scenario, the cut locations are
baked into the lengths of the substrings. Let's try it out on the example:
<br />
<br />
We have substrings of length 3, 7, and 10 because we have cuts at 3 and 10 and a
total length of 20. It looks something like this:
<br />
<br />
<script type="text/tikz">
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node (a) {3};
    \node [right of = a] (b) {7};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br />
And we are looking for a way to join them. It is important to note that only neighboring
nodes can be joined. We have two choices at this moment:
<br />
<br />
<script type="text/tikz">
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {10}
      child{ node (a) {3} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [right of = b] (c) {10};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br />
<br />
<script type="text/tikz">
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {17}
      child{ node (b) {7} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
      child{ node (c) {10} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
    \node [left of = b] (a) {3};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br />
We can also see various base cases here - when there is only 1 substring. However,
one thing to note is that we also need to keep track of the total cost to reach that
stage. If we were to go one step higher and reach 20, we realize that 20 is not the
cost but rather the cost of the last step. Let's see the example but we also keep
track of the cost:
<br />
<br />
<script type="text/tikz">
  \begin{tikzpicture}[nodes={draw, circle, minimum size=0.75cm}, ->]
    \node {(20, 30)}
      child{node {(10, 10)}
        child{ node {(3, 0)} edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}}
        child{ node {(7, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}}
        edge from parent node[left, draw=none] {}
      }
      child{node {(10, 0)} edge from parent node[right, draw=none] {}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
</script>
<br />
Huh, weird size but whatever, it gets the idea across. Now this is where things
get a little crazy. And where I had to do some manual testing to figure it out.
Let's try putting together a table:
</p>

| i\j | 3      | 7        | 10       |
| :-: | ------ | -------- | -------- |
|  3  | (3, 0) | (10, 10) |          |
|  7  |        | (7, 0)   | (17, 17) |
| 10  |        |          | (10, 0)  |

The weird thing is how to actually calculate what goes in the cells. How do I
calculate the corner? Well, first, just to be explicit, we "add" tuples with the
following function:

$$
\begin{align}
  add(a, b) = (a[0] + b[0], a[0] + b[0] + a[1] + b[1])
\end{align}
$$

Let's think back to our two trees above. We can either do
$add((3, 0), (17, 17)) = (20, 37)$ or $add((10, 10), (10, 0)) = (20, 20)$ which
is the solution. This might be obvious with the tree, and we might glance over
it in the case of two cuts, but we need to dig deeper in the case of more cuts.
<br /> <br /> Let's try cuts at 4, 6, and 9 on a string of length 15. <br />
<br /> Ok, so as usual, this leaves us with the consecutive segments: 4, 2,
3, 6. Our table looks like this after filling all the way to the 3rd diagonal:

| i\j | 4      | 2      | 3       | 6        |
| :-: | ------ | ------ | ------- | -------- |
|  4  | (4, 0) | (6, 6) | (9, 14) |          |
|  2  |        | (2, 0) | (5, 5)  | (11, 16) |
|  3  |        |        | (3, 0)  | (9, 9)   |
|  6  |        |        |         | (6, 0)   |

<p>
But what possibilities do we have for the corner now? Again, think back to the tree.
Or really, the base nodes. Let me just define $f(i, j)$ to be the entry in the table,
so we can avoid getting mixed up with the tuples. The equations we can use are
$add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$, $add(f(4, 4), f(2, 6))$, and $add(f(4, 2), f(3, 6))$. The
minimum turns out to be $add(f(4, 3), f(6, 6))$ which is $(15, 29)$. The minimum
cost is 29.
<br />
<br />
Again, how did we figure out what we could add? Well we thought about the tree, but
chances are our program won't have the luxury of looking at a tree (or we don't
want to waste time writing something like that). You probably just need to stare
at the table and draw some lines, as that's what I did, to find the pattern. Here
is a nice image:
<br />

<br />
<br />
What you should notice is that for cells on the red diagonal, we calculated the value
using cells that were a total of 2 units away from our target cell. For the blue
diagonal, we considered cells that were a total of 3 units away, and for the green
4. With this, we now have a way to figure out what cells to use when calculating.
<br />
<br />
This problem's solution (if correct) is quite different from what I've gone through
far. My guess (and then further searching) shows that my solution to this problem
is quite different from the approach suggested on various websites. Those solutions
define the problem as trying to minimize the cost of cutting a string for $i$ to
$j$. I do see the parallels though between mine solution and that one.
<br />
<br />
Because this seems like a unique solution, let's take a small stab at the complexity
here. We know there will be $(m) + (m - 1) + ... + 1$ cells. For $m$ cells (the
initial diagonal) the cost is constant to fill each one, as there is only 1 case.
However, as the diagonal increases, so do the number of cases. Refer to the previous
image; the blue diagonal had 2 cases per cell and the green 3. Therefore we come
out to something like this: $(1)(m) + (2)(m - 1) + ... (m)(1)$ calculations. The
terms of that summation seem to be $O(m^2)$ and there are a total of $m$ terms, which
leads to a $O(m^3)$ runtime.
<br />
<br />
A small thought I had afterwards: I'd like to believe that I knew I could have come
up with the standard solution everywhere else uses, but realized that was a lot of
inefficiency because there is no reason to consider splitting the string into subproblems
where cuts are not invovled.
