## Question 1

<p>
A subsequence is palindromic if it is the same whether read left to right or right
to left. For instance, the sequence
$$
\begin{align}
A, C, G, T, G, T, C, A, A, A, A, T, C, G
\end{align}
$$
has many palindromic subsequences, including $A, C, G, C, A$ and $A, A, A, A$ (on
the other hand, the subsequence $A, C, T$ is not palindromic).
<br />
<br />
Devise an algorithm that takes a sequence $x[1...n]$ and returns the (length of
the) longest contiguous palindromic subsequence. Its running time should be $O(n^2)$.
I've changed this to be contiguous subsequence because I misread the question.
<br />
<br />
So first we define the function $f(i, j)$ which determines if the sequence $x[i..j-1]$
is a palindrome. Because this is non inclusive, $f(i, i)$ has length 0 and is a palindrome.
We can also say $f(i, i + 1)$ is a palindrome since it is length 1 to save us from
calculating it (also because if we recurse, we end up getting $f(i, i - 1)$ which
we didn't fill out). We can express it in terms of itself like so:
$$
\begin{align}
    f(i, i) &= true \\
    f(i, i + 1) &= true \\
    f(i, j) &= f(i + 1, j - 1) \text { and } x[i] = x[j - 1] \\
\end{align}
$$
<br />
<br />
Why does $f(i, j)$ not calculate the length of a palindrome for $x[i..j-1]$? Because
it is $j - i$ if it is a palindrome and inapplicable if it isn't. However, we can't
just put 0 because palindromes can be length 0. If you wanted, you could end up
using lengths and an negative number to keep track of things, however we would have
modify the equation.
$$
\begin{align}
    f(i, i) &= 0 \\
    f(i, i + 1) &= 1 \\
    f(i, j) &=
        \begin{cases}
            f(i + 1, j - 1) + 2 & x[i] = x[j - 1], f(i + 1, j - 1) \neq -1 \\
            -1 & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
We won't do this for simplicities sake.
<br />
<br />
We can try this on the example, start out by filling $f(i, i)$ and then the rest
of the diagnoals. Here's a good amount of the table. I believe the rest of the empty
spaces to the top right are false.

<p>
One example of how we are able to take advantage for dynamic programming is $f(7,
11)$ or the sequence $A, A, A, A$. We already previously determine there was a palindrome
at $f(8, 10)$ so we can use this. To get the length of the longest one, we just
go through the finished table and find an entry that is true that maxmizes $j - 1$
which seems to be $i = 7$ and $j = 11$.
<br />
<br />
Actually, after solving this, I do not see a real difference in performance from
a normal approach - the palindrome must be centered at a position $i...j$, and there
is would be no repeat work done since all the pairs that would be compared are unique
to that center. Well, this explains why this wasn't the actual question.
</p>

## Question 2

<p>
Devise an algorithm that takes a sequence $x[1...n]$ and returns the (length of
the) longest palindromic subsequence. Its running time should be $O(n^2)$.
<br />
<br />
I think solving the previous question gives good insight for solving this one. We
use the same formula as above, but instead we can modify it to calculate the actual
lengths, along with a new case.
$$
\begin{align}
    f(i, i) &= 0 \\
    f(i, i + 1) &= 1 \\
    f(i, j) &=
        \begin{cases}
            f(i + 1, j - 1) + 2 &  x[i] = x[j - 1] \\
            \max(f(i + 1, j), f(i, j - 1)) & \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
\end{align}
$$
I would beware overthinking, because when I was thinking of how it would look from
the bottom up, I was wondering how this approach considered matching 1 letter added
to one that wasn't necessarily at the start of the string. For example:
$$
\begin{align}
    x[i...j] &= A, B, C, C, D &\text{ longest } &= C, C \\
    x[i...j + 1] &= A, B, C, C, D, B &\text{ longest } &= B, C, C, B \\
\end{align}
$$
Don't we need to somehow keep track that $B$ was in $x[i...j]$? The answer is no,
because $f(i + 1, j + 1)$ which is for $B, C, C, D, B$ would also be calculated,
and then $f(i, j + 1)$ would be $max(f(i + 1, j + 1), f(i + 1, j))$ which would show
that the longest is $B, C, C, B$.
<br />
<br />
Ok, here's part of the table:

<p>
And let's see how some things work. $f(0, 6)$ which is $A, C, G, T, G, T$. The
first and last letters don't match, so we go with the second case.
$$
\begin{align}
    f(0, 6) = max(f(0, 5), f(1, 6)) = 3
\end{align}
$$
$f(1, 7)$ which is $C, G, T, G, T, C$. The first and last letters match, so we go
with the first case.
$$
\begin{align}
    f(1, 7) = f(2, 6) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
\end{align}
$$
In terms of how to determine what the actual sequence is, we just need to keep track
of which case we used at each cell, and the letter that was compared if so. Let's
do some backtracking to figure out what the actual sequence for $f(1, 7)$ is.
<br />
<br />
Note that we noticed $C$ matched itself. This means the first and last letters of
the sequence are $C$ and we used $f(2, 6)$. When we calculated $f(2, 6)$, we had
a pair of non-matching letters because the sequence was $G, T, G, T$ so we used the
max of $f(2, 5)$ and $f(3, 6)$. Either one really worked as they are both 3, but
let's go with $f(3, 6)$ - $T, G, T$. The first letters match here so they $T$ is
also in our palindrome. We end with $f(4, 5)$ which is a length 1, which means $G$
is in the center, so our sequence is $C, T, G, T, C$. Alternatively, if we had used
$f(2, 5)$ we could say the sequence is $C, G, T, G, C$.
<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that we ended on $f(i, i + 1)$ which signifies a single letter.
If we ended on $f(i, i)$, then we would have to double the previous letter. An example
would be $f(8, 10)$ which is $A, A$. The first and last letters match, so we have
$A$ and end with $f(9, 9)$. This means the palindrome has an even amount of letters,
so the middle needs to be duplicated to $A, A$ rather than just $A$.
