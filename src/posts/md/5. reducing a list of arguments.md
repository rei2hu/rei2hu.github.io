# reduce a list of arguments

I've reached the part of `learnyouahaskell` about functionally solving problems.
I noticed it started out with creating a RPN calculator. This is something I've
never done before but I went ahead and did it without reading any further in order
to compare my solution with the books. Here is mine:

```haskell
solveRPN :: (Num a, Read a) => String -> a
solveRPN = (solve [0]) .  words

solve :: (Num a, Read a) => [a] -> [String] -> a
solve (a:b:st) ("+":xs) = solve ((b + a):st) xs
solve (a:b:st) ("*":xs) = solve ((b * a):st) xs
solve (a:b:st) ("-":xs) = solve ((b - a):st) xs
solve st (x:xs) = solve (read x:st) xs
solve st [] = head st
```

I spent a lot of time trying to get something else working to no avail - some kind
of fancy reduce that would work like this:

```haskell
-- (10 4 3 + 2 * -)
-- => 10 (4 3 + 2 * -)
-- => 10 4 (3 + 2 * -)
-- => 10 4 3 (+ 2 * -)
-- => 10 4 ((+ 3) 2 * -), the 3 and + get wrapped into a partially applied function
-- => 10 7 (2 * -), maybe there's an intermediate step of 10 (7 2 * -) but who knows
--                  considering I cant even get it working
-- => 10 7 2 (* -)
-- => 10 7 ((* 2) -)
-- => 10 14 (-)
-- => 4
```

I guess I'd call them dangling arguments or something if I had to give it a name.
Who knows if that's possible? I'm pretty sure I tried something similar once a long
time ago when doing something with trees, emphasis on tried.

Anyways, it is interesting to see that the solution in `learnyouahaskell` ended
up using `foldl` which is probably better.

And then there's another problem that looks like Djikstra's Algorithm which I
didn't attempt. I'm really looking forward to the next section though because
it looks like I'll start learning the fancy words (Functors, Applicative
Functors, and Monoids).
