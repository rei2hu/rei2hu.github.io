# some job application statistics

This is a somewhat public record of my job applications and responses for a period
of job searches. Most data will be encrypted until I find another job or a long enough
time has passed.

For requirements, ✔ means I guarantee have this in terms of personal and professional
experience, - means moderate experience, ✖ means anything from only personal experience
to unable to give an accurate answer by myself to 0 experience.

Sometimes I move the requirements and nice to haves around. For example if the requirement
says one of a, b, c, then I'll just mark it as generalist (a|b|c) and move a, b,
c to nice to haves.

Also maybe some random thoughts here and there:

- Initially I couldn't get the motivation to apply, but then once I started I was
  on a roll.
- Same thing for applying to jobs which require typing something up (via angel or
  workatastartup).
- Interesting thing here would be how I end up being inconsistent in rating myself
  on the same topic between job application
- What does it say about a startup when the founding engineer position is accepting
  new grads?
- For some reason I feel like a new grad still even though I have 2-3 yoe. It's interesting
  how the jobs I'm looking at are mainly put in 2 categories: senior and non senior,
  and I end up going for non senior because I have this idea that senior means 5+
  yoe at least. (granted I am not a large fan of yoe as a tell but conform to it
  because I believe other people believe in it)
- It's a little annoying when there's a discrepancy between the yoe on the job compared
  to the yoe required in the description. Mainly because it says I match when something
  needs like 1-2 years but then I read the description and it says 5+ years. Well,
  right now I'm only at a point where I apply to those that I more or less match
  or ones that I'm really interested in working at.
