# too young for nostalgia?

Maplestory.

Maplestory is a life defining game for me. Between 2006 and 2014, I spent all of
my 1 hour on the computer a day allocation and eventually most of my limitless
computer time as I grew older.

Now that I'm in my early 20s, I often think back to how much time I've spent in
the game or doing things related to it. I even listen to tracks from the soundtrack
on a regular basis.

## my first character

I remember my first character - I made an archer on Windia back when there were
"explorers" (the og classes) with the username "weaknoobie" (I guess I was self
deprecating back then, too f3).

I would rock [Orange Sporty T-Shirt](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/top/orange-sporty-t-shirt-m),
[Ice Jeans](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/bottom/ice-jeans),
[Pink Whitebottom Shoes](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/shoes/pink-whitebottom-boots),
and [Amethyst Earrings](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/earring/amethyst-earrings).

How I wish I had a picture of him.

## the non grinding experience

Although Maplestory is an MMORPG with a focus on leveling, I never had the attention
span to sit there and grind out levels - especially back when I only had 1 hour
on the computer.

Weaknoobie was actually permanently level 19 - everytime I tried to make the push
to 20 by sitting on a platform at [Henesys Hunting Ground](https://global.hidden-street.net/map/mini-map/victoria-road-henesys-hunting-ground-i)
and trying to snipe [Green Mushrooms](https://global.hidden-street.net/search/Green%20Mushroom),
I would magically end up dying and losing progress - I'm still not sure if it was
my fault or if [Orange Mushrooms](https://global.hidden-street.net/search/orange%20mushroom)
had it out for me and would keep knocking me off a safe platform to my death.

Fortunately, through several strokes of good luck, I picked up a [Zeco](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/spear/zeco)
and other somewhat expensive items or rare (like a [Sky Snowboard](https://global.hidden-street.net/eq/polearm/sky-snowboard))
to fund another kind of gameplay: exploration.

## curiosity abound

Like a virtual nomad, I made my way across the world of Maplestory - funded and
protected by a constant streak of luck and white potions.

I made my way from Victoria Island to Orbis, El Nath, Aqua Road, the depths of
Ludibrium, and even climbed down [all 100 floors of Eos Tower](https://global.hidden-street.net/map/mini-map/ludibrium-eos-tower-100th-floor)
to reach Omega Sector - all as a level 19 character - not even a thief!

There were many deaths but also many discoveries.

Back then, I was not keen on looking information up directly on the internet so each
new area was valuable to me. Hidden streets were treasures. Even now, my favorite
area in the game is [Deep Inside the Clock(?) Tower](https://global.hidden-street.net/map/mini-map/ludibrium-deep-inside-of-watch-tower)
which is a safe area located behind several maps of strong mobs which even includes
benches to sit on.

I really wish I took screenshots of those times to share along here. Reaching these
areas are probably some of my proudest moments in my entire life.

## the grind

I couldn't say the exact reason I stopped exploring - probably I died too much or
ran out of funds. This is when I started trying to level up. I don't remember the
exact details, but I remember that I ended up trying to have a key held down while
I went to do something else. Little did I realize at the time the game had something
to prevent that - namely that you can't attack from the same spot more than 100 times
in a row.

I didn't have the attention span at the time to grind so I ended up hacking - this
is actually the first step to how I got started programming. Naturally, I started
out just downloading some shady stuff off the internet and had my fun, but like most
public hacks, I ended up getting banned here and there so I gave up.

I ended up learning that the most effortless way to level was to leech off a party
and playing a priest with [Holy Symbol](https://global.hidden-street.net/search/holy%20symbol)
is the simplest way to do so. I eventually made it up to around level 125 or so pre-bb
([Big Bang](https://maplestory.fandom.com/wiki/MapleStory:_Big_Bang)).

There's an opinion out there that the Big Bang "ruined" Maplestory due to its sweeping
changes. I didn't care more or less - except the changed exp curve meant reaching
level 120 was a weeks worth of effort compared to months or years. But I was able
to level faster and the new skills and quests were fun in my opinion.

## the nail in the coffin

I was having so much fun playing, I was around level 160 or 170 I believe, why would
I have stopped?

It half comes down to hacks and half to support. Because I constantly got banned,
I ended up making temporary email addresses to create accounts with. Specifically,
my main account was made with a `trashmail2009.com` email.

I noticed this one day and sent in a support ticket to change the email to another
one. I was told this was not possible, and then a few weeks after, I started receiving
messages telling me to verify my email when attempting to login - but I couldn't
because I had no access to the email.

This is when any support ticket I sent was met with automated responses asking for
things like ID. I was so desperate, I actually faxed them my middle school ID at
the time but to no avail.

And thus ended my Maplestory run.

## reflections

Sometimes I look at what Maplestory is objectively, and I don't really understand
why I spent so much time on it.

Perhaps it had to do with having a poor family and escaping online, being able to
[explore](#curiosity-abound) and spend time freely - like [decorating a tree for
christmas](http://wayback.hidden-street.net/maps/hshillofchristmas.php) ingame.

Maybe it was because I could feel good by gifting other people with money I made
by myself online (this is one of my accounts I came across while researching the
past):

![nx-purchase-history](/blobs/18/ms.png)

Ahh, I remember this was a sale on cash shop items where you could buy them for
99 NX each. I handed out so much (note the -337 is leftover NX expiring).

Possibly it was just the atmosphere of the game, which seemed to be that of a friendly
community. Remember maple radio? Weirdly enough I got a happy birthday email to
my bishop a few years back.

![maple-radio](/blobs/18/maple-radio.png)

What a great name for a bishop honestly, I must've been a genius back then. But
not as smart as the person who took the original name - if I remember correctly,
that guy was only a priest i.e. between level 70 and 119.

Nowdays, the only things I have to do with the game are listening to the soundtracks
, occasionally playing on private servers just to re-experience the older game,
and wonder how I have these old details stuck in my head.

Here are some of my favorite tracks.

I would suggest [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLARr36qkoiWa2hl6cXnBxNzU_xxLcQXs0),
too.

So in conclusion, no I'm not too young for nostalgia.
