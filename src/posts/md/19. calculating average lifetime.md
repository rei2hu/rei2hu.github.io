# calculating average lifetime

Recently I came across a simple problem which was to get the average time something
lived given it's replacement schedule. For example we might be given a data like
this:

| Item      | Part   | Replaced On |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| something | Part A | Oct 1       |
| something | Part A | Oct 3       |
| something | Part A | Oct 4       |
| something | Part A | Oct 5       |
| something | Part A | Oct 5       |
| something | Part A | Oct 6       |
| something | Part A | Oct 7       |
| something | Part B | Oct 1       |
| something | Part B | Oct 4       |
| something | Part B | Oct 6       |
| something | Part B | Oct 9       |
| something | Part B | Oct 12      |

If we were to calculate the average time for Part A, we would calculate the time
between each replacement for a specific part, add them up, and divide by the number
of those values. This ends up being an average of 1 day because

| Range         | Duration |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Oct 1 - Oct 3 | 2        |
| Oct 3 - Oct 4 | 1        |
| Oct 4 - Oct 5 | 1        |
| Oct 5 - Oct 5 | 0        |
| Oct 5 - Oct 6 | 1        |
| Oct 6 - Oct 7 | 1        |
|               |          |
| total:        | 6        |
| average:      | 1        |

This is great and all but then I realized the basic formula to get the sum of the
intervals in between the values is something like

<p>
$(x_2 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_2) + ... + (x_n - x_{n - 1}) = (x_n - x_1)$ <br />
where $x_n$ is the value of the $n$th entry
</p>

If we apply that to the above, we get Oct 7 - Oct 1 which is 6, the sum we got
earlier, which we then divide by $n - 1$ for the average of 1. Weirdly enough, I
think I was lucky to realize this as the original formula is simple enough to write
and I would'nt have bothered looking for any optimizations.

Even at first glance, it was interesting that it boiled down to this but after a
quick visualization it makes perfect sense. Here is what it might look like for
Part B.

```text
Oct 1
|           Oct 12
|###        |
    ##      |
      ###   |
         ###|
```

We see that the length of the intervals in between ends up being the length between
the start and end (again, very obvious now but I don't know how I never realized
it before). And then we can get the average which is 11 / 4.

## conclusion

I'm pretty sure I've come across similar problems about the sum of intervals in
a set of numbers but I never actually had this realization because I wasn't looking
closely.

It's interesting how things like this might be overlooked when something already
start out looking simple.
