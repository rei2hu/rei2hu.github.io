# monads

Monads seem pretty straightforward. However, I think that `learnyouahaskell` should
have gone a little more in-depth into how `guard` is working instead of showing
some examples so I figured I should look into it.

First, let's review the types of the operators:

```haskell
(>>=) :: (Monad m) => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
(>>) :: (Monad m) => m a -> m b -> m b
x >> y = x >>= \_ -> y
```

And we're also given the implementation of `guard`:

```haskell
guard :: (MonadPlus m) => Bool -> m ()
guard True = return ()
guard False = mzero
-- something to note is that running :t guard actually gives a slightly different
-- type guard :: GHC.Base.Alternative f => Bool -> f ()
-- the difference here is the method names and mainly that MonadPlus has a Monad
-- constraint while Alternative has an Applicative constraint (right now, Applicative
-- is a superclass of Monad)
```

And I wanted to understand exactly how `\x -> guard x >> return "cool"` worked.
We are shown a few things:

```haskell
guard (2 > 5) :: [()]
-- []
guard (5 > 2) :: [()]
-- [()]
guard (5 > 2) >> return "cool" :: [String]
-- ["cool"]
```

I think one problem was that I was thinking of `>>` as just returning the second
argument since the type was `m a -> m b -> m b` which made me think of
`x -> y -> y`. But really that's pretty far off. So I stepped through it slowly:

```haskell
-- definition for >>= in the instance Monad []
xs >>= f = concat (map f xs)
-- therefore
guard (5 > 2) >> return "cool"
-- => guard (5 > 2) >>= \_ -> return "cool"
-- => [()] >>= \_ -> return "cool"
-- => concat (map (\_ -> return "cool") [()])
-- => ["cool"]
```

So when I saw this, I realized that because `guard False = mzero` is the failure
(eg for lists the empty list) it is basically filtered from a the list. As such,
when we look at the full example we understand how it works:

```haskell
[1..50] >>= (\x -> guard ('7' `elem` show x) >> return x)
-- => concat (map (\x -> guard ('7' `elem` show x) >> return x) [1..50])
-- example of one
-- => (\x -> guard ('7' `elem` show x) >> return x) 27
-- => guard ('7' `elem` show 27) >> return x
-- => [27] because the above function is like :: (Num a, Show a) => [a]
```
